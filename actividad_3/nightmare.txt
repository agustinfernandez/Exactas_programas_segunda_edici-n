It is possible to\nsay that it is a gripping adventure story of murderous criminals and brilliant\npolicemen; but it was to be expected that the author of the Father Brown\nstories should tell a detective story like no-one else. On this level,\ntherefore, THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY succeeds superbly; if nothing else, it is\na magnificent tour-de-force of suspense-writing.\n\nHowever, the reader will soon discover that it is much more than that. Carried\nalong on the boisterous rush of the narrative by Chestertons wonderful high-\nspirited style, he will soon see that he is being carried into much deeper\nwaters than he had planned on; and the totally unforeseeable denouement will\nprove for the modern reader, as it has for thousands of others since 1908 when\nthe book was first published, an inevitable and moving experience, as the\ninvestigators finally discover who Sunday is.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY  \nA NIGHTMARE\n\nTo Edmund Clerihew Bentley\n\n    \n    \r\n      A cloud was on the mind of men, and wailing went the weather,\r\n      Yea, a sick cloud upon the soul when we were boys together.\r\n      Science announced nonentity and art admired decay;\r\n      The world was old and ended: but you and I were gay;\r\n      Round us in antic order their crippled vices came\r\n      Lust that had lost its laughter, fear that had lost its shame.\r\n      Like the white lock of Whistler, that lit our aimless gloom,\r\n      Men showed their own white feather as proudly as a plume.\r\n      Life was a fly that faded, and death a drone that stung;\r\n      The world was very old indeed when you and I were young.\r\n      They twisted even decent sin to shapes not to be named:\r\n      Men were ashamed of honour; but we were not ashamed.\r\n      Weak if we were and foolish, not thus we failed, not thus;\r\n      When that black Baal blocked the heavens he had no hymns from us\r\n      Children we wereour forts of sand were even as weak as we,\r\n      High as they went we piled them up to break that bitter sea.\r\n      Fools as we were in motley, all jangling and absurd,\r\n      When all church bells were silent our cap and bells were heard.\r\n    \r\n      Not all unhelped we held the fort, our tiny flags unfurled;\r\n      Some giants laboured in that cloud to lift it from the world.\r\n      I find again the book we found, I feel the hour that flings\r\n      Far out of fish-shaped Paumanok some cry of cleaner things;\r\n      And the Green Carnation withered, as in forest fires that pass,\r\n      Roared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass;\r\n      Or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain\r\n      Truth out of Tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain.\r\n      Yea, cool and clear and sudden as a bird sings in the grey,\r\n      Dunedin to Samoa spoke, and darkness unto day.\r\n      But we were young; we lived to see God break their bitter charms.\r\n      God and the good Republic come riding back in arms:\r\n      We have seen the City of Mansoul, even as it rocked, relieved\r\n      Blessed are they who did not see, but being blind, believed.\r\n    \r\n      This is a tale of those old fears, even of those emptied hells,\r\n      And none but you shall understand the true thing that it tells\r\n      Of what colossal gods of shame could cow men and yet crash,\r\n      Of what huge devils hid the stars, yet fell at a pistol flash.\r\n      The doubts that were so plain to chase, so dreadful to withstand\r\n      Oh, who shall understand but you; yea, who shall understand?\r\n      The doubts that drove us through the night as we two talked amain,\r\n      And day had broken on the streets eer it broke upon the brain.\r\n      Between us, by the peace of God, such truth can now be told;\r\n      Yea, there is strength in striking root and good in growing old.\r\n      We have found common things at last and marriage and a creed,\r\n      And I may safely write it now, and you may safely read.\r\n    \r\n      G.

It was built of a bright brick throughout; its sky-line\nwas fantastic, and even its ground plan was wild. It had been the outburst of\na speculative builder, faintly tinged with art, who called its architecture\nsometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne, apparently under the\nimpression that the two sovereigns were identical. It was described with some\njustice as an artistic colony, though it never in any definable way produced\nany art. But although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a\nlittle vague, its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable.\nThe stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only\nthink how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them. Nor\nwhen he met the people was he disappointed in this respect. The place was not\nonly pleasant, but perfect, if once he could regard it not as a deception but\nrather as a dream. Even if the people were not artists, the whole was\nnevertheless artistic. That young man with the long, auburn hair and the\nimpudent facethat young man was not really a poet; but surely he was a poem.\nThat old gentleman with the wild, white beard and the wild, white hatthat\nvenerable humbug was not really a philosopher; but at least he was the cause\nof philosophy in others. That scientific gentleman with the bald, egg-like\nhead and the bare, bird-like neck had no real right to the airs of science\nthat he assumed. He had not discovered anything new in biology; but what\nbiological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself? Thus,\nand thus only, the whole place had properly to be regarded; it had to be\nconsidered not so much as a workshop for artists, but as a frail but finished\nwork of art. A man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had\nstepped into a written comedy.\n\nMore especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall, when\nthe extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane\nvillage seemed as separate as a drifting cloud. This again was more strongly\ntrue of the many nights of local festivity, when the little gardens were often\nilluminated, and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like\nsome fierce and monstrous fruit. And this was strongest of all on one\nparticular evening, still vaguely remembered in the locality, of which the\nauburn-haired poet was the hero. It was not by any means the only evening of\nwhich he was the hero. On many nights those passing by his little back garden\nmight hear his high, didactic voice laying down the law to men and\nparticularly to women. The attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of\nthe paradoxes of the place. Most of the women were of the kind vaguely called\nemancipated, and professed some protest against male supremacy. Yet these new\nwomen would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary\nwoman ever pays to him, that of listening while he is talking. And Mr. Lucian\nGregory, the red-haired poet, was really (in some sense) a man worth listening\nto, even if one only laughed at the end of it. He put the old cant of the\nlawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent\nfreshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure. He was helped in some\ndegree by the arresting oddity of his appearance, which he worked, as the\nphrase goes, for all it was worth. His dark red hair parted in the middle was\nliterally like a womans, and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-\nRaphaelite picture. From within this almost saintly oval, however, his face\nprojected suddenly broad and brutal, the chin carried forward with a look of\ncockney contempt. This combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of\na neurotic population. He seemed like a walking blasphemy, a blend of the\nangel and the ape.\n\nThis particular evening, if it is remembered for nothing else, will be\nremembered in that place for its strange sunset. It looked like the end of the\nworld. All the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage;\nyou could only say that the sky was full of feathers, and of feathers that\nalmost brushed the face. Across the great part of the dome they were grey,\nwith the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale\ngreen; but towards the west the whole grew past description, transparent and\npassionate, and the last red-hot plumes of it covered up the sun like\nsomething too good to be seen. The whole was so close about the earth, as to\nexpress nothing but a violent secrecy. The very empyrean seemed to be a\nsecret. It expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local\npatriotism. The very sky seemed small.\n\nI say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by\nthat oppressive sky. There are others who may remember it because it marked\nthe first appearance in the place of the second poet of Saffron Park. For a\nlong time the red-haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival; it was\nupon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended. The new poet,\nwho introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very mild-looking\nmortal, with a fair, pointed beard and faint, yellow hair. But an impression\ngrew that he was less meek than he looked. He signalised his entrance by\ndiffering with the established poet, Gregory, upon the whole nature of poetry.\nHe said that he (Syme) was poet of law, a poet of order; nay, he said he was a\npoet of respectability. So all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had\nthat moment fallen out of that impossible sky.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Lucian Gregory, the anarchic poet, connected the two events.\n\nIt may well be, he said, in his sudden lyrical manner, it may well be on\nsuch a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the\nearth such a portent as a respectable poet. You say you are a poet of law; I\nsay you are a contradiction in terms. I only wonder there were not comets and\nearthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden.\n\nThe man with the meek blue eyes and the pale, pointed beard endured these\nthunders with a certain submissive solemnity. The third party of the group,\nGregorys sister Rosamond, who had her brothers braids of red hair, but a\nkindlier face underneath them, laughed with such mixture of admiration and\ndisapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle.\n\nGregory resumed in high oratorical good humour.\n\nAn artist is identical with an anarchist, he cried. You might transpose the\nwords anywhere. An anarchist is an artist. The man who throws a bomb is an\nartist, because he prefers a great moment to everything. He sees how much more\nvaluable is one burst of blazing light, one peal of perfect thunder, than the\nmere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen. An artist disregards all\ngovernments, abolishes all conventions. The poet delights in disorder only. If\nit were not so, the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground\nRailway.\n\nSo it is, said Mr. Syme.\n\nNonsense! said Gregory, who was very rational when anyone else attempted\nparadox. Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad\nand tired, so very sad and tired? I will tell you. It is because they know\nthat the train is going right. It is because they know that whatever place\nthey have taken a ticket for that place they will reach. It is because after\nthey have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be\nVictoria, and nothing but Victoria. Oh, their wild rapture! oh, their eyes\nlike stars and their souls again in Eden, if the next station were\nunaccountably Baker Street!\n\nIt is you who are unpoetical, replied the poet Syme. If what you say of\nclerks is true, they can only be as prosaic as your poetry. The rare, strange\nthing is to hit the mark; the gross, obvious thing is to miss it. We feel it\nis epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird. Is it not also\nepical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station? Chaos is dull;\nbecause in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere, to Baker Street or to\nBagdad. But man is a magician, and his whole magic is in this, that he does\nsay Victoria, and lo! it is Victoria. No, take your books of mere poetry and\nprose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who\ncommemorates the defeats of man; give me Bradshaw, who commemorates his\nvictories. Give me Bradshaw, I say!\n\nMust you go? inquired Gregory sarcastically.\n\nI tell you, went on Syme with passion, that every time a train comes in I\nfeel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers, and that man has won a\nbattle against chaos. You say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane\nSquare one must come to Victoria. I say that one might do a thousand things\ninstead, and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth\nescape. And when I hear the guard shout out the word Victoria, it is not an\nunmeaning word. It is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest. It is to\nme indeed Victoria; it is the victory of Adam.\n\nGregory wagged his heavy, red head with a slow and sad smile.\n\nAnd even then, he said, we poets always ask the question, And what is\nVictoria now that you have got there? You think Victoria is like the New\nJerusalem. We know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria. Yes, the\npoet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven. The poet is always in\nrevolt.\n\nThere again, said Syme irritably, what is there poetical about being in\nrevolt? You might as well say that it is poetical to be sea-sick. Being sick\nis a revolt. Both being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing\non certain desperate occasions; but Im hanged if I can see why they are\npoetical. Revolt in the abstract isrevolting. Its mere vomiting.\n\nThe girl winced for a flash at the unpleasant word, but Syme was too hot to\nheed her.\n\nIt is things going right, he cried, that is poetical! Our digestions, for\ninstance, going sacredly and silently right, that is the foundation of all\npoetry. Yes, the most poetical thing, more poetical than the flowers, more\npoetical than the starsthe most poetical thing in the world is not being\nsick.\n\nReally, said Gregory superciliously, the examples you choose\n\nI beg your pardon, said Syme grimly, I forgot we had abolished all\nconventions.\n\nFor the first time a red patch appeared on Gregorys forehead.\n\nYou dont expect me, he said, to revolutionise society on this lawn?\n\nSyme looked straight into his eyes and smiled sweetly.\n\nNo, I dont, he said; but I suppose that if you were serious about your\nanarchism, that is exactly what you would do.\n\nGregorys big bulls eyes blinked suddenly like those of an angry lion, and\none could almost fancy that his red mane rose.\n\nDont you think, then, he said in a dangerous voice, that I am serious\nabout my anarchism?\n\nI beg your pardon? said Syme.\n\nAm I not serious about my anarchism? cried Gregory, with knotted fists.\n\nMy dear fellow! said Syme, and strolled away.\n\nWith surprise, but with a curious pleasure, he found Rosamond Gregory still in\nhis company.\n\nMr. Syme, she said, do the people who talk like you and my brother often\nmean what they say? Do you mean what you say now?\n\nSyme smiled.\n\nDo you? he asked.\n\nWhat do you mean? asked the girl, with grave eyes.\n\nMy dear Miss Gregory, said Syme gently, there are many kinds of sincerity\nand insincerity. When you say thank you for the salt, do you mean what you\nsay? No. When you say the world is round, do you mean what you say? No. It\nis true, but you dont mean it. Now, sometimes a man like your brother really\nfinds a thing he does mean. It may be only a half-truth, quarter-truth, tenth-\ntruth; but then he says more than he meansfrom sheer force of meaning it.\n\nShe was looking at him from under level brows; her face was grave and open,\nand there had fallen upon it the shadow of that unreasoning responsibility\nwhich is at the bottom of the most frivolous woman, the maternal watch which\nis as old as the world.\n\nIs he really an anarchist, then? she asked.\n\nOnly in that sense I speak of, replied Syme; or if you prefer it, in that\nnonsense.\n\nShe drew her broad brows together and said abruptly\n\nHe wouldnt really usebombs or that sort of thing?\n\nSyme broke into a great laugh, that seemed too large for his slight and\nsomewhat dandified figure.\n\nGood Lord, no! he said, that has to be done anonymously.\n\nAnd at that the corners of her own mouth broke into a smile, and she thought\nwith a simultaneous pleasure of Gregorys absurdity and of his safety.\n\nSyme strolled with her to a seat in the corner of the garden, and continued to\npour out his opinions. For he was a sincere man, and in spite of his\nsuperficial airs and graces, at root a humble one. And it is always the humble\nman who talks too much; the proud man watches himself too closely. He defended\nrespectability with violence and exaggeration. He grew passionate in his\npraise of tidiness and propriety. All the time there was a smell of lilac all\nround him. Once he heard very faintly in some distant street a barrel-organ\nbegin to play, and it seemed to him that his heroic words were moving to a\ntiny tune from under or beyond the world.\n\nHe stared and talked at the girls red hair and amused face for what seemed to\nbe a few minutes; and then, feeling that the groups in such a place should\nmix, rose to his feet. To his astonishment, he discovered the whole garden\nempty. Everyone had gone long ago, and he went himself with a rather hurried\napology. He left with a sense of champagne in his head, which he could not\nafterwards explain. In the wild events which were to follow this girl had no\npart at all; he never saw her again until all his tale was over. And yet, in\nsome indescribable way, she kept recurring like a motive in music through all\nhis mad adventures afterwards, and the glory of her strange hair ran like a\nred thread through those dark and ill-drawn tapestries of the night. For what\nfollowed was so improbable, that it might well have been a dream.\n\nWhen Syme went out into the starlit street, he found it for the moment empty.\nThen he realised (in some odd way) that the silence was rather a living\nsilence than a dead one. Directly outside the door stood a street lamp, whose\ngleam gilded the leaves of the tree that bent out over the fence behind him.\nAbout a foot from the lamp-post stood a figure almost as rigid and motionless\nas the lamp-post itself. The tall hat and long frock coat were black; the\nface, in an abrupt shadow, was almost as dark. Only a fringe of fiery hair\nagainst the light, and also something aggressive in the attitude, proclaimed\nthat it was the poet Gregory. He had something of the look of a masked bravo\nwaiting sword in hand for his foe.\n\nHe made a sort of doubtful salute, which Syme somewhat more formally returned.\n\nI was waiting for you, said Gregory. Might I have a moments conversation?\n\nCertainly. About what? asked Syme in a sort of weak wonder.\n\nGregory struck out with his stick at the lamp-post, and then at the tree.\nAbout this and this, he cried; about order and anarchy. There is your\nprecious order, that lean, iron lamp, ugly and barren; and there is anarchy,\nrich, living, reproducing itselfthere is anarchy, splendid in green and\ngold.\n\nAll the same, replied Syme patiently, just at present you only see the tree\nby the light of the lamp. I wonder when you would ever see the lamp by the\nlight of the tree. Then after a pause he said, But may I ask if you have\nbeen standing out here in the dark only to resume our little argument?\n\nNo, cried out Gregory, in a voice that rang down the street, I did not\nstand here to resume our argument, but to end it for ever.\n\nThe silence fell again, and Syme, though he understood nothing, listened\ninstinctively for something serious. Gregory began in a smooth voice and with\na rather bewildering smile.\n\nMr. Syme, he said, this evening you succeeded in doing something rather\nremarkable. You did something to me that no man born of woman has ever\nsucceeded in doing before.\n\nIndeed!\n\nNow I remember, resumed Gregory reflectively, one other person succeeded in\ndoing it. The captain of a penny steamer (if I remember correctly) at\nSouthend. You have irritated me.\n\nI am very sorry, replied Syme with gravity.\n\nI am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even\nwith an apology, said Gregory very calmly. No duel could wipe it out. If I\nstruck you dead I could not wipe it out. There is only one way by which that\ninsult can be erased, and that way I choose. I am going, at the possible\nsacrifice of my life and honour, to prove to you that you were wrong in what\nyou said.\n\nIn what I said?\n\nYou said I was not serious about being an anarchist.\n\nThere are degrees of seriousness, replied Syme. I have never doubted that\nyou were perfectly sincere in this sense, that you thought what you said well\nworth saying, that you thought a paradox might wake men up to a neglected\ntruth.\n\nGregory stared at him steadily and painfully.\n\nAnd in no other sense, he asked, you think me serious? You think me a\nflaneur who lets fall occasional truths. You do not think that in a deeper, a\nmore deadly sense, I am serious.\n\nSyme struck his stick violently on the stones of the road.\n\nSerious! he cried. Good Lord! is this street serious? Are these damned\nChinese lanterns serious? Is the whole caboodle serious? One comes here and\ntalks a pack of bosh, and perhaps some sense as well, but I should think very\nlittle of a man who didnt keep something in the background of his life that\nwas more serious than all this talkingsomething more serious, whether it was\nreligion or only drink.\n\nVery well, said Gregory, his face darkening, you shall see something more\nserious than either drink or religion.\n\nSyme stood waiting with his usual air of mildness until Gregory again opened\nhis lips.\n\nYou spoke just now of having a religion. Is it really true that you have\none?\n\nOh, said Syme with a beaming smile, we are all Catholics now.\n\nThen may I ask you to swear by whatever gods or saints your religion involves\nthat you will not reveal what I am now going to tell you to any son of Adam,\nand especially not to the police? Will you swear that! If you will take upon\nyourself this awful abnegation if you will consent to burden your soul with a\nvow that you should never make and a knowledge you should never dream about, I\nwill promise you in return\n\nYou will promise me in return? inquired Syme, as the other paused.\n\nI will promise you a very entertaining evening. Syme suddenly took off his\nhat.\n\nYour offer, he said, is far too idiotic to be declined. You say that a poet\nis always an anarchist. I disagree; but I hope at least that he is always a\nsportsman. Permit me, here and now, to swear as a Christian, and promise as a\ngood comrade and a fellow-artist, that I will not report anything of this,\nwhatever it is, to the police. And now, in the name of Colney Hatch, what is\nit?\n\nI think, said Gregory, with placid irrelevancy, that we will call a cab.\n\nHe gave two long whistles, and a hansom came rattling down the road. The two\ngot into it in silence. Gregory gave through the trap the address of an\nobscure public-house on the Chiswick bank of the river. The cab whisked itself\naway again, and in it these two fantastics quitted their fantastic town.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER II. THE SECRET OF GABRIEL SYME\n\nTHE cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop, into which\nGregory rapidly conducted his companion. They seated themselves in a close and\ndim sort of bar-parlour, at a stained wooden table with one wooden leg. The\nroom was so small and dark, that very little could be seen of the attendant\nwho was summoned, beyond a vague and dark impression of something bulky and\nbearded.\n\nWill you take a little supper? asked Gregory politely. The pate de foie\ngras is not good here, but I can recommend the game.\n\nSyme received the remark with stolidity, imagining it to be a joke. Accepting\nthe vein of humour, he said, with a well-bred indifference\n\nOh, bring me some lobster mayonnaise.\n\nTo his indescribable astonishment, the man only said Certainly, sir! and\nwent away apparently to get it.\n\nWhat will you drink? resumed Gregory, with the same careless yet apologetic\nair. I shall only have a creme de menthe myself; I have dined. But the\nchampagne can really be trusted. Do let me start you with a half-bottle of\nPommery at least?\n\nThank you! said the motionless Syme. You are very good.\n\nHis further attempts at conversation, somewhat disorganised in themselves,\nwere cut short finally as by a thunderbolt by the actual appearance of the\nlobster. Syme tasted it, and found it particularly good. Then he suddenly\nbegan to eat with great rapidity and appetite.\n\nExcuse me if I enjoy myself rather obviously! he said to Gregory, smiling.\nI dont often have the luck to have a dream like this. It is new to me for a\nnightmare to lead to a lobster. It is commonly the other way.\n\nYou are not asleep, I assure you, said Gregory. You are, on the contrary,\nclose to the most actual and rousing moment of your existence. Ah, here comes\nyour champagne! I admit that there may be a slight disproportion, let us say,\nbetween the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and\nunpretentious exterior. But that is all our modesty. We are the most modest\nmen that ever lived on earth.\n\nAnd who are we? asked Syme, emptying his champagne glass.\n\nIt is quite simple, replied Gregory. We are the serious anarchists, in whom\nyou do not believe.\n\nOh! said Syme shortly. You do yourselves well in drinks.\n\nYes, we are serious about everything, answered Gregory.\n\nThen after a pause he added\n\nIf in a few moments this table begins to turn round a little, dont put it\ndown to your inroads into the champagne. I dont wish you to do yourself an\ninjustice.\n\nWell, if I am not drunk, I am mad, replied Syme with perfect calm; but I\ntrust I can behave like a gentleman in either condition. May I smoke?\n\nCertainly! said Gregory, producing a cigar-case. Try one of mine.\n\nSyme took the cigar, clipped the end off with a cigar-cutter out of his\nwaistcoat pocket, put it in his mouth, lit it slowly, and let out a long cloud\nof smoke. It is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with\nso much composure, for almost before he had begun them the table at which he\nsat had begun to revolve, first slowly, and then rapidly, as if at an insane\nseance.\n\nYou must not mind it, said Gregory; its a kind of screw.\n\nQuite so, said Syme placidly, a kind of screw. How simple that is!\n\nThe next moment the smoke of his cigar, which had been wavering across the\nroom in snaky twists, went straight up as if from a factory chimney, and the\ntwo, with their chairs and table, shot down through the floor as if the earth\nhad swallowed them. They went rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as\nrapidly as a lift cut loose, and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom.\nBut when Gregory threw open a pair of doors and let in a red subterranean\nlight, Syme was still smoking with one leg thrown over the other, and had not\nturned a yellow hair.\n\nGregory led him down a low, vaulted passage, at the end of which was the red\nlight. It was an enormous crimson lantern, nearly as big as a fireplace, fixed\nover a small but heavy iron door. In the door there was a sort of hatchway or\ngrating, and on this Gregory struck five times. A heavy voice with a foreign\naccent asked him who he was. To this he gave the more or less unexpected\nreply, Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. The heavy hinges began to move; it was\nobviously some kind of password.\n\nInside the doorway the passage gleamed as if it were lined with a network of\nsteel. On a second glance, Syme saw that the glittering pattern was really\nmade up of ranks and ranks of rifles and revolvers, closely packed or\ninterlocked.\n\nI must ask you to forgive me all these formalities, said Gregory; we have\nto be very strict here.\n\nOh, dont apologise, said Syme. I know your passion for law and order, and\nhe stepped into the passage lined with the steel weapons. With his long, fair\nhair and rather foppish frock-coat, he looked a singularly frail and fanciful\nfigure as he walked down that shining avenue of death.\n\nThey passed through several such passages, and came out at last into a queer\nsteel chamber with curved walls, almost spherical in shape, but presenting,\nwith its tiers of benches, something of the appearance of a scientific\nlecture-theatre. There were no rifles or pistols in this apartment, but round\nthe walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes, things that looked\nlike the bulbs of iron plants, or the eggs of iron birds. They were bombs, and\nthe very room itself seemed like the inside of a bomb. Syme knocked his cigar\nash off against the wall, and went in.\n\nAnd now, my dear Mr. Syme, said Gregory, throwing himself in an expansive\nmanner on the bench under the largest bomb, now we are quite cosy, so let us\ntalk properly. Now no human words can give you any notion of why I brought you\nhere. It was one of those quite arbitrary emotions, like jumping off a cliff\nor falling in love. Suffice it to say that you were an inexpressibly\nirritating fellow, and, to do you justice, you are still. I would break twenty\noaths of secrecy for the pleasure of taking you down a peg. That way you have\nof lighting a cigar would make a priest break the seal of confession. Well,\nyou said that you were quite certain I was not a serious anarchist. Does this\nplace strike you as being serious?\n\nIt does seem to have a moral under all its gaiety, assented Syme; but may I\nask you two questions? You need not fear to give me information, because, as\nyou remember, you very wisely extorted from me a promise not to tell the\npolice, a promise I shall certainly keep. So it is in mere curiosity that I\nmake my queries. First of all, what is it really all about? What is it you\nobject to? You want to abolish Government?\n\nTo abolish God! said Gregory, opening the eyes of a fanatic. We do not only\nwant to upset a few despotisms and police regulations; that sort of anarchism\ndoes exist, but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists. We dig deeper and\nwe blow you higher. We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice\nand virtue, honour and treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The\nsilly sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man! We\nhate Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and Wrong.\n\nAnd Right and Left, said Syme with a simple eagerness, I hope you will\nabolish them too. They are much more troublesome to me.\n\nYou spoke of a second question, snapped Gregory.\n\nWith pleasure, resumed Syme. In all your present acts and surroundings\nthere is a scientific attempt at secrecy. I have an aunt who lived over a\nshop, but this is the first time I have found people living from preference\nunder a public-house. You have a heavy iron door. You cannot pass it without\nsubmitting to the humiliation of calling yourself Mr. Chamberlain. You\nsurround yourself with steel instruments which make the place, if I may say\nso, more impressive than homelike. May I ask why, after taking all this\ntrouble to barricade yourselves in the bowels of the earth, you then parade\nyour whole secret by talking about anarchism to every silly woman in Saffron\nPark?\n\nGregory smiled.\n\nThe answer is simple, he said. I told you I was a serious anarchist, and\nyou did not believe me. Nor do they believe me. Unless I took them into this\ninfernal room they would not believe me.\n\nSyme smoked thoughtfully, and looked at him with interest. Gregory went on.\n\nThe history of the thing might amuse you, he said. When first I became one\nof the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises. I dressed up\nas a bishop. I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets, in\nSuperstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey. I certainly understood from them\nthat bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from\nmankind. I was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in\na drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, Down! down! presumptuous\nhuman reason! they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all. I\nwas nabbed at once. Then I made up as a millionaire; but I defended Capital\nwith so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor. Then I\ntried being a major. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope,\nenough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like\nNietzsche, admire violencethe proud, mad war of Nature and all that, you\nknow. I threw myself into the major. I drew my sword and waved it constantly.\nI called out Blood! abstractedly, like a man calling for wine. I often said,\nLet the weak perish; it is the Law. Well, well, it seems majors dont do\nthis. I was nabbed again. At last I went in despair to the President of the\nCentral Anarchist Council, who is the greatest man in Europe.\n\nWhat is his name? asked Syme.\n\nYou would not know it, answered Gregory. That is his greatness. Caesar and\nNapoleon put all their genius into being heard of, and they were heard of. He\nputs all his genius into not being heard of, and he is not heard of. But you\ncannot be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that Caesar\nand Napoleon would have been children in his hands.\n\nHe was silent and even pale for a moment, and then resumed\n\nBut whenever he gives advice it is always something as startling as an\nepigram, and yet as practical as the Bank of England. I said to him, What\ndisguise will hide me from the world? What can I find more respectable than\nbishops and majors? He looked at me with his large but indecipherable face.\nYou want a safe disguise, do you? You want a dress which will guarantee you\nharmless; a dress in which no one would ever look for a bomb? I nodded. He\nsuddenly lifted his lions voice. Why, then, dress up as an anarchist, you\nfool! he roared so that the room shook. Nobody will ever expect you to do\nanything dangerous then. And he turned his broad back on me without another\nword. I took his advice, and have never regretted it. I preached blood and\nmurder to those women day and night, andby God!they would let me wheel their\nperambulators.\n\nSyme sat watching him with some respect in his large, blue eyes.\n\nYou took me in, he said. It is really a smart dodge.\n\nThen after a pause he added\n\nWhat do you call this tremendous President of yours?\n\nWe generally call him Sunday, replied Gregory with simplicity. You see,\nthere are seven members of the Central Anarchist Council, and they are named\nafter days of the week. He is called Sunday, by some of his admirers Bloody\nSunday. It is curious you should mention the matter, because the very night\nyou have dropped in (if I may so express it) is the night on which our London\nbranch, which assembles in this room, has to elect its own deputy to fill a\nvacancy in the Council. The gentleman who has for some time past played, with\npropriety and general applause, the difficult part of Thursday, has died quite\nsuddenly. Consequently, we have called a meeting this very evening to elect a\nsuccessor.\n\nHe got to his feet and strolled across the room with a sort of smiling\nembarrassment.\n\nI feel somehow as if you were my mother, Syme, he continued casually. I\nfeel that I can confide anything to you, as you have promised to tell nobody.\nIn fact, I will confide to you something that I would not say in so many words\nto the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes. We\nshall, of course, go through a form of election; but I dont mind telling you\nthat it is practically certain what the result will be. He looked down for a\nmoment modestly. It is almost a settled thing that I am to be Thursday.\n\nMy dear fellow. said Syme heartily, I congratulate you. A great career!\n\nGregory smiled in deprecation, and walked across the room, talking rapidly.\n\nAs a matter of fact, everything is ready for me on this table, he said, and\nthe ceremony will probably be the shortest possible.\n\nSyme also strolled across to the table, and found lying across it a walking-\nstick, which turned out on examination to be a sword-stick, a large Colts\nrevolver, a sandwich case, and a formidable flask of brandy. Over the chair,\nbeside the table, was thrown a heavy-looking cape or cloak.\n\nI have only to get the form of election finished, continued Gregory with\nanimation, then I snatch up this cloak and stick, stuff these other things\ninto my pocket, step out of a door in this cavern, which opens on the river,\nwhere there is a steam-tug already waiting for me, and thenthenoh, the wild\njoy of being Thursday! And he clasped his hands.\n\nSyme, who had sat down once more with his usual insolent languor, got to his\nfeet with an unusual air of hesitation.\n\nWhy is it, he asked vaguely, that I think you are quite a decent fellow?\nWhy do I positively like you, Gregory? He paused a moment, and then added\nwith a sort of fresh curiosity, Is it because you are such an ass?\n\nThere was a thoughtful silence again, and then he cried out\n\nWell, damn it all! this is the funniest situation I have ever been in in my\nlife, and I am going to act accordingly. Gregory, I gave you a promise before\nI came into this place. That promise I would keep under red-hot pincers. Would\nyou give me, for my own safety, a little promise of the same kind?\n\nA promise? asked Gregory, wondering.\n\nYes, said Syme very seriously, a promise. I swore before God that I would\nnot tell your secret to the police. Will you swear by Humanity, or whatever\nbeastly thing you believe in, that you will not tell my secret to the\nanarchists?\n\nYour secret? asked the staring Gregory. Have you got a secret?\n\nYes, said Syme, I have a secret. Then after a pause, Will you swear?\n\nGregory glared at him gravely for a few moments, and then said abruptly\n\nYou must have bewitched me, but I feel a furious curiosity about you. Yes, I\nwill swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me. But look sharp,\nfor they will be here in a couple of minutes.\n\nSyme rose slowly to his feet and thrust his long, white hands into his long,\ngrey trousers pockets. Almost as he did so there came five knocks on the\nouter grating, proclaiming the arrival of the first of the conspirators.\n\nWell, said Syme slowly, I dont know how to tell you the truth more shortly\nthan by saying that your expedient of dressing up as an aimless poet is not\nconfined to you or your President. We have known the dodge for some time at\nScotland Yard.\n\nGregory tried to spring up straight, but he swayed thrice.\n\nWhat do you say? he asked in an inhuman voice.\n\nYes, said Syme simply, I am a police detective. But I think I hear your\nfriends coming.\n\nFrom the doorway there came a murmur of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain. It was\nrepeated twice and thrice, and then thirty times, and the crowd of Joseph\nChamberlains (a solemn thought) could be heard trampling down the corridor.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER III. THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY\n\nBEFORE one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway, Gregorys stunned\nsurprise had fallen from him. He was beside the table with a bound, and a\nnoise in his throat like a wild beast. He caught up the Colts revolver and\ntook aim at Syme. Syme did not flinch, but he put up a pale and polite hand.\n\nDont be such a silly man, he said, with the effeminate dignity of a curate.\nDont you see its not necessary? Dont you see that were both in the same\nboat? Yes, and jolly sea-sick.\n\nGregory could not speak, but he could not fire either, and he looked his\nquestion.\n\nDont you see weve checkmated each other? cried Syme. I cant tell the\npolice you are an anarchist. You cant tell the anarchists Im a policeman. I\ncan only watch you, knowing what you are; you can only watch me, knowing what\nI am. In short, its a lonely, intellectual duel, my head against yours. Im a\npoliceman deprived of the help of the police. You, my poor fellow, are an\nanarchist deprived of the help of that law and organisation which is so\nessential to anarchy. The one solitary difference is in your favour. You are\nnot surrounded by inquisitive policemen; I am surrounded by inquisitive\nanarchists. I cannot betray you, but I might betray myself. Come, come! wait\nand see me betray myself. I shall do it so nicely.\n\nGregory put the pistol slowly down, still staring at Syme as if he were a sea-\nmonster.\n\nI dont believe in immortality, he said at last, but if, after all this,\nyou were to break your word, God would make a hell only for you, to howl in\nfor ever.\n\nI shall not break my word, said Syme sternly, nor will you break yours.\nHere are your friends.\n\nThe mass of the anarchists entered the room heavily, with a slouching and\nsomewhat weary gait; but one little man, with a black beard and glassesa man\nsomewhat of the type of Mr. Tim Healydetached himself, and bustled forward\nwith some papers in his hand.\n\nComrade Gregory, he said, I suppose this man is a delegate?\n\nGregory, taken by surprise, looked down and muttered the name of Syme; but\nSyme replied almost pertly\n\nI am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for\nanyone to be here who was not a delegate.\n\nThe brow of the little man with the black beard was, however, still contracted\nwith something like suspicion.\n\nWhat branch do you represent? he asked sharply.\n\nI should hardly call it a branch, said Syme, laughing; I should call it at\nthe very least a root.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThe fact is, said Syme serenely, the truth is I am a Sabbatarian. I have\nbeen specially sent here to see that you show a due observance of Sunday.\n\nThe little man dropped one of his papers, and a flicker of fear went over all\nthe faces of the group. Evidently the awful President, whose name was Sunday,\ndid sometimes send down such irregular ambassadors to such branch meetings.\n\nWell, comrade, said the man with the papers after a pause, I suppose wed\nbetter give you a seat in the meeting?\n\nIf you ask my advice as a friend, said Syme with severe benevolence, I\nthink youd better.\n\nWhen Gregory heard the dangerous dialogue end, with a sudden safety for his\nrival, he rose abruptly and paced the floor in painful thought. He was,\nindeed, in an agony of diplomacy. It was clear that Symes inspired impudence\nwas likely to bring him out of all merely accidental dilemmas. Little was to\nbe hoped from them. He could not himself betray Syme, partly from honour, but\npartly also because, if he betrayed him and for some reason failed to destroy\nhim, the Syme who escaped would be a Syme freed from all obligation of\nsecrecy, a Syme who would simply walk to the nearest police station. After\nall, it was only one nights discussion, and only one detective who would know\nof it. He would let out as little as possible of their plans that night, and\nthen let Syme go, and chance it.\n\nHe strode across to the group of anarchists, which was already distributing\nitself along the benches.\n\nI think it is time we began, he said; the steam-tug is waiting on the river\nalready. I move that Comrade Buttons takes the chair.\n\nThis being approved by a show of hands, the little man with the papers slipped\ninto the presidential seat.\n\nComrades, he began, as sharp as a pistol-shot, our meeting tonight is\nimportant, though it need not be long. This branch has always had the honour\nof electing Thursdays for the Central European Council. We have elected many\nand splendid Thursdays. We all lament the sad decease of the heroic worker who\noccupied the post until last week. As you know, his services to the cause were\nconsiderable. He organised the great dynamite coup of Brighton which, under\nhappier circumstances, ought to have killed everybody on the pier. As you also\nknow, his death was as self-denying as his life, for he died through his faith\nin a hygienic mixture of chalk and water as a substitute for milk, which\nbeverage he regarded as barbaric, and as involving cruelty to the cow.\nCruelty, or anything approaching to cruelty, revolted him always. But it is\nnot to acclaim his virtues that we are met, but for a harder task. It is\ndifficult properly to praise his qualities, but it is more difficult to\nreplace them. Upon you, comrades, it devolves this evening to choose out of\nthe company present the man who shall be Thursday. If any comrade suggests a\nname I will put it to the vote. If no comrade suggests a name, I can only tell\nmyself that that dear dynamiter, who is gone from us, has carried into the\nunknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence.\n\nThere was a stir of almost inaudible applause, such as is sometimes heard in\nchurch. Then a large old man, with a long and venerable white beard, perhaps\nthe only real working-man present, rose lumberingly and said\n\nI move that Comrade Gregory be elected Thursday, and sat lumberingly down\nagain.\n\nDoes anyone second? asked the chairman.\n\nA little man with a velvet coat and pointed beard seconded.\n\nBefore I put the matter to the vote, said the chairman, I will call on\nComrade Gregory to make a statement.\n\nGregory rose amid a great rumble of applause. His face was deadly pale, so\nthat by contrast his queer red hair looked almost scarlet. But he was smiling\nand altogether at ease. He had made up his mind, and he saw his best policy\nquite plain in front of him like a white road. His best chance was to make a\nsoftened and ambiguous speech, such as would leave on the detectives mind the\nimpression that the anarchist brotherhood was a very mild affair after all. He\nbelieved in his own literary power, his capacity for suggesting fine shades\nand picking perfect words. He thought that with care he could succeed, in\nspite of all the people around him, in conveying an impression of the\ninstitution, subtly and delicately false. Syme had once thought that\nanarchists, under all their bravado, were only playing the fool. Could he not\nnow, in the hour of peril, make Syme think so again?\n\nComrades, began Gregory, in a low but penetrating voice, it is not\nnecessary for me to tell you what is my policy, for it is your policy also.\nOur belief has been slandered, it has been disfigured, it has been utterly\nconfused and concealed, but it has never been altered. Those who talk about\nanarchism and its dangers go everywhere and anywhere to get their information,\nexcept to us, except to the fountain head. They learn about anarchists from\nsixpenny novels; they learn about anarchists from tradesmens newspapers; they\nlearn about anarchists from Ally Slopers Half-Holiday and the Sporting Times.\nThey never learn about anarchists from anarchists. We have no chance of\ndenying the mountainous slanders which are heaped upon our heads from one end\nof Europe to another. The man who has always heard that we are walking plagues\nhas never heard our reply. I know that he will not hear it tonight, though my\npassion were to rend the roof. For it is deep, deep under the earth that the\npersecuted are permitted to assemble, as the Christians assembled in the\nCatacombs. But if, by some incredible accident, there were here tonight a man\nwho all his life had thus immensely misunderstood us, I would put this\nquestion to him: When those Christians met in those Catacombs, what sort of\nmoral reputation had they in the streets above? What tales were told of their\natrocities by one educated Roman to another? Suppose (I would say to him),\nsuppose that we are only repeating that still mysterious paradox of history.\nSuppose we seem as shocking as the Christians because we are really as\nharmless as the Christians. Suppose we seem as mad as the Christians because\nwe are really as meek.\n\nThe applause that had greeted the opening sentences had been gradually growing\nfainter, and at the last word it stopped suddenly. In the abrupt silence, the\nman with the velvet jacket said, in a high, squeaky voice\n\nIm not meek!\n\nComrade Witherspoon tells us, resumed Gregory, that he is not meek. Ah, how\nlittle he knows himself! His words are, indeed, extravagant; his appearance is\nferocious, and even (to an ordinary taste) unattractive. But only the eye of a\nfriendship as deep and delicate as mine can perceive the deep foundation of\nsolid meekness which lies at the base of him, too deep even for himself to\nsee. I repeat, we are the true early Christians, only that we come too late.\nWe are simple, as they revere simplelook at Comrade Witherspoon. We are\nmodest, as they were modestlook at me. We are merciful\n\nNo, no! called out Mr. Witherspoon with the velvet jacket.\n\nI say we are merciful, repeated Gregory furiously, as the early Christians\nwere merciful. Yet this did not prevent their being accused of eating human\nflesh. We do not eat human flesh\n\nShame! cried Witherspoon. Why not?\n\nComrade Witherspoon, said Gregory, with a feverish gaiety, is anxious to\nknow why nobody eats him (laughter). In our society, at any rate, which loves\nhim sincerely, which is founded upon love\n\nNo, no! said Witherspoon, down with love.\n\nWhich is founded upon love, repeated Gregory, grinding his teeth, there\nwill be no difficulty about the aims which we shall pursue as a body, or which\nI should pursue were I chosen as the representative of that body. Superbly\ncareless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human\nsociety, we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure,\nthe permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity.\n\nGregory resumed his seat and passed his hand across his forehead. The silence\nwas sudden and awkward, but the chairman rose like an automaton, and said in a\ncolourless voice\n\nDoes anyone oppose the election of Comrade Gregory?\n\nThe assembly seemed vague and sub-consciously disappointed, and Comrade\nWitherspoon moved restlessly on his seat and muttered in his thick beard. By\nthe sheer rush of routine, however, the motion would have been put and\ncarried. But as the chairman was opening his mouth to put it, Syme sprang to\nhis feet and said in a small and quiet voice\n\nYes, Mr. Chairman, I oppose.\n\nThe most effective fact in oratory is an unexpected change in the voice. Mr.\nGabriel Syme evidently understood oratory. Having said these first formal\nwords in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity, he made his next word\nring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off.\n\nComrades! he cried, in a voice that made every man jump out of his boots,\nhave we come here for this? Do we live underground like rats in order to\nlisten to talk like this? This is talk we might listen to while eating buns at\na Sunday School treat. Do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door\nwith death lest anyone should come and hear Comrade Gregory saying to us, Be\ngood, and you will be happy, Honesty is the best policy, and Virtue is its\nown reward? There was not a word in Comrade Gregorys address to which a\ncurate could not have listened with pleasure (hear, hear). But I am not a\ncurate (loud cheers), and I did not listen to it with pleasure (renewed\ncheers). The man who is fitted to make a good curate is not fitted to make a\nresolute, forcible, and efficient Thursday (hear, hear).\n\nComrade Gregory has told us, in only too apologetic a tone, that we are not\nthe enemies of society. But I say that we are the enemies of society, and so\nmuch the worse for society. We are the enemies of society, for society is the\nenemy of humanity, its oldest and its most pitiless enemy (hear, hear).\nComrade Gregory has told us (apologetically again) that we are not murderers.\nThere I agree. We are not murderers, we are executioners (cheers).\n\nEver since Syme had risen Gregory had sat staring at him, his face idiotic\nwith astonishment. Now in the pause his lips of clay parted, and he said, with\nan automatic and lifeless distinctness\n\nYou damnable hypocrite!\n\nSyme looked straight into those frightful eyes with his own pale blue ones,\nand said with dignity\n\nComrade Gregory accuses me of hypocrisy. He knows as well as I do that I am\nkeeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty. I do not mince\nwords. I do not pretend to. I say that Comrade Gregory is unfit to be Thursday\nfor all his amiable qualities. He is unfit to be Thursday because of his\namiable qualities. We do not want the Supreme Council of Anarchy infected with\na maudlin mercy (hear, hear). This is no time for ceremonial politeness,\nneither is it a time for ceremonial modesty. I set myself against Comrade\nGregory as I would set myself against all the Governments of Europe, because\nthe anarchist who has given himself to anarchy has forgotten modesty as much\nas he has forgotten pride (cheers). I am not a man at all. I am a cause\n(renewed cheers). I set myself against Comrade Gregory as impersonally and as\ncalmly as I should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon\nthe wall; and I say that rather than have Gregory and his milk-and-water\nmethods on the Supreme Council, I would offer myself for election\n\nHis sentence was drowned in a deafening cataract of applause. The faces, that\nhad grown fiercer and fiercer with approval as his tirade grew more and more\nuncompromising, were now distorted with grins of anticipation or cloven with\ndelighted cries. At the moment when he announced himself as ready to stand for\nthe post of Thursday, a roar of excitement and assent broke forth, and became\nuncontrollable, and at the same moment Gregory sprang to his feet, with foam\nupon his mouth, and shouted against the shouting.\n\nStop, you blasted madmen! he cried, at the top of a voice that tore his\nthroat. Stop, you\n\nBut louder than Gregorys shouting and louder than the roar of the room came\nthe voice of Syme, still speaking in a peal of pitiless thunder\n\nI do not go to the Council to rebut that slander that calls us murderers; I\ngo to earn it (loud and prolonged cheering). To the priest who says these men\nare the enemies of religion, to the judge who says these men are the enemies\nof law, to the fat parliamentarian who says these men are the enemies of order\nand public decency, to all these I will reply, You are false kings, but you\nare true prophets. I am come to destroy you, and to fulfil your prophecies.\n\nThe heavy clamour gradually died away, but before it had ceased Witherspoon\nhad jumped to his feet, his hair and beard all on end, and had said\n\nI move, as an amendment, that Comrade Syme be appointed to the post.\n\nStop all this, I tell you! cried Gregory, with frantic face and hands. Stop\nit, it is all\n\nThe voice of the chairman clove his speech with a cold accent.\n\nDoes anyone second this amendment? he said. A tall, tired man, with\nmelancholy eyes and an American chin beard, was observed on the back bench to\nbe slowly rising to his feet. Gregory had been screaming for some time past;\nnow there was a change in his accent, more shocking than any scream. I end\nall this! he said, in a voice as heavy as stone.\n\nThis man cannot be elected. He is a\n\nYes, said Syme, quite motionless, what is he? Gregorys mouth worked twice\nwithout sound; then slowly the blood began to crawl back into his dead face.\nHe is a man quite inexperienced in our work, he said, and sat down abruptly.\n\nBefore he had done so, the long, lean man with the American beard was again\nupon his feet, and was repeating in a high American monotone\n\nI beg to second the election of Comrade Syme.\n\nThe amendment will, as usual, be put first, said Mr. Buttons, the chairman,\nwith mechanical rapidity.\n\nThe question is that Comrade Syme\n\nGregory had again sprung to his feet, panting and passionate.\n\nComrades, he cried out, I am not a madman.\n\nOh, oh! said Mr. Witherspoon.\n\nI am not a madman, reiterated Gregory, with a frightful sincerity which for\na moment staggered the room, but I give you a counsel which you can call mad\nif you like. No, I will not call it a counsel, for I can give you no reason\nfor it. I will call it a command. Call it a mad command, but act upon it.\nStrike, but hear me! Kill me, but obey me! Do not elect this man. Truth is so\nterrible, even in fetters, that for a moment Symes slender and insane victory\nswayed like a reed. But you could not have guessed it from Symes bleak blue\neyes. He merely began\n\nComrade Gregory commands\n\nThen the spell was snapped, and one anarchist called out to Gregory\n\nWho are you? You are not Sunday; and another anarchist added in a heavier\nvoice, And you are not Thursday.\n\nComrades, cried Gregory, in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy\nof pain has passed beyond pain, it is nothing to me whether you detest me as\na tyrant or detest me as a slave. If you will not take my command, accept my\ndegradation. I kneel to you. I throw myself at your feet. I implore you. Do\nnot elect this man.\n\nComrade Gregory, said the chairman after a painful pause, this is really\nnot quite dignified.\n\nFor the first time in the proceedings there was for a few seconds a real\nsilence. Then Gregory fell back in his seat, a pale wreck of a man, and the\nchairman repeated, like a piece of clock-work suddenly started again\n\nThe question is that Comrade Syme be elected to the post of Thursday on the\nGeneral Council.\n\nThe roar rose like the sea, the hands rose like a forest, and three minutes\nafterwards Mr. Gabriel Syme, of the Secret Police Service, was elected to the\npost of Thursday on the General Council of the Anarchists of Europe.\n\nEveryone in the room seemed to feel the tug waiting on the river, the sword-\nstick and the revolver, waiting on the table. The instant the election was\nended and irrevocable, and Syme had received the paper proving his election,\nthey all sprang to their feet, and the fiery groups moved and mixed in the\nroom. Syme found himself, somehow or other, face to face with Gregory, who\nstill regarded him with a stare of stunned hatred. They were silent for many\nminutes.\n\nYou are a devil! said Gregory at last.\n\nAnd you are a gentleman, said Syme with gravity.\n\nIt was you that entrapped me, began Gregory, shaking from head to foot,\nentrapped me into\n\nTalk sense, said Syme shortly. Into what sort of devils parliament have\nyou entrapped me, if it comes to that? You made me swear before I made you.\nPerhaps we are both doing what we think right. But what we think right is so\ndamned different that there can be nothing between us in the way of\nconcession. There is nothing possible between us but honour and death, and he\npulled the great cloak about his shoulders and picked up the flask from the\ntable.\n\nThe boat is quite ready, said Mr. Buttons, bustling up. Be good enough to\nstep this way.\n\nWith a gesture that revealed the shop-walker, he led Syme down a short, iron-\nbound passage, the still agonised Gregory following feverishly at their heels.\nAt the end of the passage was a door, which Buttons opened sharply, showing a\nsudden blue and silver picture of the moonlit river, that looked like a scene\nin a theatre. Close to the opening lay a dark, dwarfish steam-launch, like a\nbaby dragon with one red eye.\n\nAlmost in the act of stepping on board, Gabriel Syme turned to the gaping\nGregory.\n\nYou have kept your word, he said gently, with his face in shadow. You are a\nman of honour, and I thank you. You have kept it even down to a small\nparticular. There was one special thing you promised me at the beginning of\nthe affair, and which you have certainly given me by the end of it.\n\nWhat do you mean? cried the chaotic Gregory. What did I promise you?\n\nA very entertaining evening, said Syme, and he made a military salute with\nthe sword-stick as the steamboat slid away.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER IV. THE TALE OF A DETECTIVE\n\nGABRIEL SYME was not merely a detective who pretended to be a poet; he was\nreally a poet who had become a detective. Nor was his hatred of anarchy\nhypocritical. He was one of those who are driven early in life into too\nconservative an attitude by the bewildering folly of most revolutionists. He\nhad not attained it by any tame tradition. His respectability was spontaneous\nand sudden, a rebellion against rebellion. He came of a family of cranks, in\nwhich all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles\nalways walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful\nattempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art\nand self-realisation; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the\nchild, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink\nbetween the extremes of absinth and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy\ndislike. The more his mother preached a more than Puritan abstinence the more\ndid his father expand into a more than pagan latitude; and by the time the\nformer had come to enforcing vegetarianism, the latter had pretty well reached\nthe point of defending cannibalism.\n\nBeing surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel\nhad to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing leftsanity.\nBut there was just enough in him of the blood of these fanatics to make even\nhis protest for common sense a little too fierce to be sensible. His hatred of\nmodern lawlessness had been crowned also by an accident. It happened that he\nwas walking in a side street at the instant of a dynamite outrage. He had been\nblind and deaf for a moment, and then seen, the smoke clearing, the broken\nwindows and the bleeding faces. After that he went about as usualquiet,\ncourteous, rather gentle; but there was a spot on his mind that was not sane.\nHe did not regard anarchists, as most of us do, as a handful of morbid men,\ncombining ignorance with intellectualism. He regarded them as a huge and\npitiless peril, like a Chinese invasion.\n\nHe poured perpetually into newspapers and their waste-paper baskets a torrent\nof tales, verses and violent articles, warning men of this deluge of barbaric\ndenial. But he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy, and, what was worse,\nno nearer a living. As he paced the Thames embankment, bitterly biting a cheap\ncigar and brooding on the advance of Anarchy, there was no anarchist with a\nbomb in his pocket so savage or so solitary as he. Indeed, he always felt that\nGovernment stood alone and desperate, with its back to the wall. He was too\nquixotic to have cared for it otherwise.\n\nHe walked on the Embankment once under a dark red sunset. The red river\nreflected the red sky, and they both reflected his anger. The sky, indeed, was\nso swarthy, and the light on the river relatively so lurid, that the water\nalmost seemed of fiercer flame than the sunset it mirrored. It looked like a\nstream of literal fire winding under the vast caverns of a subterranean\ncountry.\n\nSyme was shabby in those days. He wore an old-fashioned black chimney-pot hat;\nhe was wrapped in a yet more old-fashioned cloak, black and ragged; and the\ncombination gave him the look of the early villains in Dickens and Bulwer\nLytton. Also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when\nthey appeared long afterwards, cut and pointed, on the lawns of Saffron Park.\nA long, lean, black cigar, bought in Soho for twopence, stood out from between\nhis tightened teeth, and altogether he looked a very satisfactory specimen of\nthe anarchists upon whom he had vowed a holy war. Perhaps this was why a\npoliceman on the Embankment spoke to him, and said Good evening.\n\nSyme, at a crisis of his morbid fears for humanity, seemed stung by the mere\nstolidity of the automatic official, a mere bulk of blue in the twilight.\n\nA good evening is it? he said sharply. You fellows would call the end of\nthe world a good evening. Look at that bloody red sun and that bloody river! I\ntell you that if that were literally human blood, spilt and shining, you would\nstill be standing here as solid as ever, looking out for some poor harmless\ntramp whom you could move on. You policemen are cruel to the poor, but I could\nforgive you even your cruelty if it were not for your calm.\n\nIf we are calm, replied the policeman, it is the calm of organised\nresistance.\n\nEh? said Syme, staring.\n\nThe soldier must be calm in the thick of the battle, pursued the policeman.\nThe composure of an army is the anger of a nation.\n\nGood God, the Board Schools! said Syme. Is this undenominational\neducation?\n\nNo, said the policeman sadly, I never had any of those advantages. The\nBoard Schools came after my time. What education I had was very rough and old-\nfashioned, I am afraid.\n\nWhere did you have it? asked Syme, wondering.\n\nOh, at Harrow, said the policeman\n\nThe class sympathies which, false as they are, are the truest things in so\nmany men, broke out of Syme before he could control them.\n\nBut, good Lord, man, he said, you oughtnt to be a policeman!\n\nThe policeman sighed and shook his head.\n\nI know, he said solemnly, I know I am not worthy.\n\nBut why did you join the police? asked Syme with rude curiosity.\n\nFor much the same reason that you abused the police, replied the other. I\nfound that there was a special opening in the service for those whose fears\nfor humanity were concerned rather with the aberrations of the scientific\nintellect than with the normal and excusable, though excessive, outbreaks of\nthe human will. I trust I make myself clear.\n\nIf you mean that you make your opinion clear, said Syme, I suppose you do.\nBut as for making yourself clear, it is the last thing you do. How comes a man\nlike you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the Thames embankment?\n\nYou have evidently not heard of the latest development in our police system,\nreplied the other. I am not surprised at it. We are keeping it rather dark\nfrom the educated class, because that class contains most of our enemies. But\nyou seem to be exactly in the right frame of mind. I think you might almost\njoin us.\n\nJoin you in what? asked Syme.\n\nI will tell you, said the policeman slowly. This is the situation: The head\nof one of our departments, one of the most celebrated detectives in Europe,\nhas long been of opinion that a purely intellectual conspiracy would soon\nthreaten the very existence of civilisation. He is certain that the scientific\nand artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the Family and the\nState. He has, therefore, formed a special corps of policemen, policemen who\nare also philosophers. It is their business to watch the beginnings of this\nconspiracy, not merely in a criminal but in a controversial sense. I am a\ndemocrat myself, and I am fully aware of the value of the ordinary man in\nmatters of ordinary valour or virtue. But it would obviously be undesirable to\nemploy the common policeman in an investigation which is also a heresy hunt.\n\nSymes eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity.\n\nWhat do you do, then? he said.\n\nThe work of the philosophical policeman, replied the man in blue, is at\nonce bolder and more subtle than that of the ordinary detective. The ordinary\ndetective goes to pot-houses to arrest thieves; we go to artistic tea-parties\nto detect pessimists. The ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a\ndiary that a crime has been committed. We discover from a book of sonnets that\na crime will be committed. We have to trace the origin of those dreadful\nthoughts that drive men on at last to intellectual fanaticism and intellectual\ncrime. We were only just in time to prevent the assassination at Hartlepool,\nand that was entirely due to the fact that our Mr. Wilks (a smart young\nfellow) thoroughly understood a triolet.\n\nDo you mean, asked Syme, that there is really as much connection between\ncrime and the modern intellect as all that?\n\nYou are not sufficiently democratic, answered the policeman, but you were\nright when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal\nwas a pretty brutal business. I tell you I am sometimes sick of my trade when\nI see how perpetually it means merely a war upon the ignorant and the\ndesperate. But this new movement of ours is a very different affair. We deny\nthe snobbish English assumption that the uneducated are the dangerous\ncriminals. We remember the Roman Emperors. We remember the great poisoning\nprinces of the Renaissance. We say that the dangerous criminal is the educated\ncriminal. We say that the most dangerous criminal now is the entirely lawless\nmodern philosopher. Compared to him, burglars and bigamists are essentially\nmoral men; my heart goes out to them. They accept the essential ideal of man;\nthey merely seek it wrongly. Thieves respect property. They merely wish the\nproperty to become their property that they may more perfectly respect it. But\nphilosophers dislike property as property; they wish to destroy the very idea\nof personal possession. Bigamists respect marriage, or they would not go\nthrough the highly ceremonial and even ritualistic formality of bigamy. But\nphilosophers despise marriage as marriage. Murderers respect human life; they\nmerely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the\nsacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives. But philosophers hate life\nitself, their own as much as other peoples.\n\nSyme struck his hands together.\n\nHow true that is, he cried. I have felt it from my boyhood, but never could\nstate the verbal antithesis. The common criminal is a bad man, but at least he\nis, as it were, a conditional good man. He says that if only a certain\nobstacle be removedsay a wealthy unclehe is then prepared to accept the\nuniverse and to praise God. He is a reformer, but not an anarchist. He wishes\nto cleanse the edifice, but not to destroy it. But the evil philosopher is not\ntrying to alter things, but to annihilate them. Yes, the modern world has\nretained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and\nignominious, the harrying of the poor, the spying upon the unfortunate. It has\ngiven up its more dignified work, the punishment of powerful traitors in the\nState and powerful heresiarchs in the Church. The moderns say we must not\npunish heretics. My only doubt is whether we have a right to punish anybody\nelse.\n\nBut this is absurd! cried the policeman, clasping his hands with an\nexcitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume, but it is\nintolerable! I dont know what youre doing, but youre wasting your life. You\nmust, you shall, join our special army against anarchy. Their armies are on\nour frontiers. Their bolt is ready to fall. A moment more, and you may lose\nthe glory of working with us, perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes\nof the world.\n\nIt is a chance not to be missed, certainly, assented Syme, but still I do\nnot quite understand. I know as well as anybody that the modern world is full\nof lawless little men and mad little movements. But, beastly as they are, they\ngenerally have the one merit of disagreeing with each other. How can you talk\nof their leading one army or hurling one bolt. What is this anarchy?\n\nDo not confuse it, replied the constable, with those chance dynamite\noutbreaks from Russia or from Ireland, which are really the outbreaks of\noppressed, if mistaken, men. This is a vast philosophic movement, consisting\nof an outer and an inner ring. You might even call the outer ring the laity\nand the inner ring the priesthood. I prefer to call the outer ring the\ninnocent section, the inner ring the supremely guilty section. The outer\nringthe main mass of their supportersare merely anarchists; that is, men who\nbelieve that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness. They believe\nthat all the evil results of human crime are the results of the system that\nhas called it crime. They do not believe that the crime creates the\npunishment. They believe that the punishment has created the crime. They\nbelieve that if a man seduced seven women he would naturally walk away as\nblameless as the flowers of spring. They believe that if a man picked a pocket\nhe would naturally feel exquisitely good. These I call the innocent section.\n\nOh! said Syme.\n\nNaturally, therefore, these people talk about a happy time coming; the\nparadise of the future; mankind freed from the bondage of vice and the\nbondage of virtue, and so on. And so also the men of the inner circle\nspeakthe sacred priesthood. They also speak to applauding crowds of the\nhappiness of the future, and of mankind freed at last. But in their\nmouthsand the policeman lowered his voicein their mouths these happy\nphrases have a horrible meaning. They are under no illusions; they are too\nintellectual to think that man upon this earth can ever be quite free of\noriginal sin and the struggle. And they mean death. When they say that mankind\nshall be free at last, they mean that mankind shall commit suicide. When they\ntalk of a paradise without right or wrong, they mean the grave.\n\nThey have but two objects, to destroy first humanity and then themselves.\nThat is why they throw bombs instead of firing pistols. The innocent rank and\nfile are disappointed because the bomb has not killed the king; but the high-\npriesthood are happy because it has killed somebody.\n\nHow can I join you? asked Syme, with a sort of passion.\n\nI know for a fact that there is a vacancy at the moment, said the policeman,\nas I have the honour to be somewhat in the confidence of the chief of whom I\nhave spoken. You should really come and see him. Or rather, I should not say\nsee him, nobody ever sees him; but you can talk to him if you like.\n\nTelephone? inquired Syme, with interest.\n\nNo, said the policeman placidly, he has a fancy for always sitting in a\npitch-dark room. He says it makes his thoughts brighter. Do come along.\n\nSomewhat dazed and considerably excited, Syme allowed himself to be led to a\nside-door in the long row of buildings of Scotland Yard. Almost before he knew\nwhat he was doing, he had been passed through the hands of about four\nintermediate officials, and was suddenly shown into a room, the abrupt\nblackness of which startled him like a blaze of light. It was not the ordinary\ndarkness, in which forms can be faintly traced; it was like going suddenly\nstone-blind.\n\nAre you the new recruit? asked a heavy voice.\n\nAnd in some strange way, though there was not the shadow of a shape in the\ngloom, Syme knew two things: first, that it came from a man of massive\nstature; and second, that the man had his back to him.\n\nAre you the new recruit? said the invisible chief, who seemed to have heard\nall about it. All right. You are engaged.\n\nSyme, quite swept off his feet, made a feeble fight against this irrevocable\nphrase.\n\nI really have no experience, he began.\n\nNo one has any experience, said the other, of the Battle of Armageddon.\n\nBut I am really unfit\n\nYou are willing, that is enough, said the unknown.\n\nWell, really, said Syme, I dont know any profession of which mere\nwillingness is the final test.\n\nI do, said the othermartyrs. I am condemning you to death. Good day.\n\nThus it was that when Gabriel Syme came out again into the crimson light of\nevening, in his shabby black hat and shabby, lawless cloak, he came out a\nmember of the New Detective Corps for the frustration of the great conspiracy.\nActing under the advice of his friend the policeman (who was professionally\ninclined to neatness), he trimmed his hair and beard, bought a good hat, clad\nhimself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue-grey, with a pale yellow\nflower in the button-hole, and, in short, became that elegant and rather\ninsupportable person whom Gregory had first encountered in the little garden\nof Saffron Park. Before he finally left the police premises his friend\nprovided him with a small blue card, on which was written, The Last Crusade,\nand a number, the sign of his official authority. He put this carefully in his\nupper waistcoat pocket, lit a cigarette, and went forth to track and fight the\nenemy in all the drawing-rooms of London. Where his adventure ultimately led\nhim we have already seen. At about half-past one on a February night he found\nhimself steaming in a small tug up the silent Thames, armed with swordstick\nand revolver, the duly elected Thursday of the Central Council of Anarchists.\n\nWhen Syme stepped out on to the steam-tug he had a singular sensation of\nstepping out into something entirely new; not merely into the landscape of a\nnew land, but even into the landscape of a new planet. This was mainly due to\nthe insane yet solid decision of that evening, though partly also to an entire\nchange in the weather and the sky since he entered the little tavern some two\nhours before. Every trace of the passionate plumage of the cloudy sunset had\nbeen swept away, and a naked moon stood in a naked sky. The moon was so strong\nand full that (by a paradox often to be noticed) it seemed like a weaker sun.\nIt gave, not the sense of bright moonshine, but rather of a dead daylight.\n\nOver the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration, as of\nthat disastrous twilight which Milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclipse;\nso that Syme fell easily into his first thought, that he was actually on some\nother and emptier planet, which circled round some sadder star. But the more\nhe felt this glittering desolation in the moonlit land, the more his own\nchivalric folly glowed in the night like a great fire. Even the common things\nhe carried with himthe food and the brandy and the loaded pistoltook on\nexactly that concrete and material poetry which a child feels when he takes a\ngun upon a journey or a bun with him to bed. The sword-stick and the brandy-\nflask, though in themselves only the tools of morbid conspirators, became the\nexpressions of his own more healthy romance. The sword-stick became almost the\nsword of chivalry, and the brandy the wine of the stirrup-cup. For even the\nmost dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure; the\nadventures may be mad, but the adventurer must be sane. The dragon without St.\nGeorge would not even be grotesque. So this inhuman landscape was only\nimaginative by the presence of a man really human. To Symes exaggerative mind\nthe bright, bleak houses and terraces by the Thames looked as empty as the\nmountains of the moon. But even the moon is only poetical because there is a\nman in the moon.\n\nThe tug was worked by two men, and with much toil went comparatively slowly.\nThe clear moon that had lit up Chiswick had gone down by the time that they\npassed Battersea, and when they came under the enormous bulk of Westminster\nday had already begun to break. It broke like the splitting of great bars of\nlead, showing bars of silver; and these had brightened like white fire when\nthe tug, changing its onward course, turned inward to a large landing stage\nrather beyond Charing Cross.\n\nThe great stones of the Embankment seemed equally dark and gigantic as Syme\nlooked up at them. They were big and black against the huge white dawn. They\nmade him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some Egyptian\npalace; and, indeed, the thing suited his mood, for he was, in his own mind,\nmounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings. He leapt\nout of the boat on to one slimy step, and stood, a dark and slender figure,\namid the enormous masonry. The two men in the tug put her off again and turned\nup stream. They had never spoken a word.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER V. THE FEAST OF FEAR\n\nAT first the large stone stair seemed to Syme as deserted as a pyramid; but\nbefore he reached the top he had realised that there was a man leaning over\nthe parapet of the Embankment and looking out across the river. As a figure he\nwas quite conventional, clad in a silk hat and frock-coat of the more formal\ntype of fashion; he had a red flower in his buttonhole. As Syme drew nearer to\nhim step by step, he did not even move a hair; and Syme could come close\nenough to notice even in the dim, pale morning light that his face was long,\npale and intellectual, and ended in a small triangular tuft of dark beard at\nthe very point of the chin, all else being clean-shaven. This scrap of hair\nalmost seemed a mere oversight; the rest of the face was of the type that is\nbest shavenclear-cut, ascetic, and in its way noble. Syme drew closer and\ncloser, noting all this, and still the figure did not stir.\n\nAt first an instinct had told Syme that this was the man whom he was meant to\nmeet. Then, seeing that the man made no sign, he had concluded that he was\nnot. And now again he had come back to a certainty that the man had something\nto do with his mad adventure. For the man remained more still than would have\nbeen natural if a stranger had come so close. He was as motionless as a wax-\nwork, and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way. Syme looked again and\nagain at the pale, dignified and delicate face, and the face still looked\nblankly across the river. Then he took out of his pocket the note from Buttons\nproving his election, and put it before that sad and beautiful face. Then the\nman smiled, and his smile was a shock, for it was all on one side, going up in\nthe right cheek and down in the left.\n\nThere was nothing, rationally speaking, to scare anyone about this. Many\npeople have this nervous trick of a crooked smile, and in many it is even\nattractive. But in all Symes circumstances, with the dark dawn and the deadly\nerrand and the loneliness on the great dripping stones, there was something\nunnerving in it.\n\nThere was the silent river and the silent man, a man of even classic face. And\nthere was the last nightmare touch that his smile suddenly went wrong.\n\nThe spasm of smile was instantaneous, and the mans face dropped at once into\nits harmonious melancholy. He spoke without further explanation or inquiry,\nlike a man speaking to an old colleague.\n\nIf we walk up towards Leicester Square, he said, we shall just be in time\nfor breakfast. Sunday always insists on an early breakfast. Have you had any\nsleep?\n\nNo, said Syme.\n\nNor have I, answered the man in an ordinary tone. I shall try to get to bed\nafter breakfast.\n\nHe spoke with casual civility, but in an utterly dead voice that contradicted\nthe fanaticism of his face. It seemed almost as if all friendly words were to\nhim lifeless conveniences, and that his only life was hate. After a pause the\nman spoke again.\n\nOf course, the Secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told.\nBut the one thing that can never be told is the last notion of the President,\nfor his notions grow like a tropical forest. So in case you dont know, Id\nbetter tell you that he is carrying out his notion of concealing ourselves by\nnot concealing ourselves to the most extraordinary lengths just now.\nOriginally, of course, we met in a cell underground, just as your branch does.\nThen Sunday made us take a private room at an ordinary restaurant. He said\nthat if you didnt seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out. Well, he is the\nonly man on earth, I know; but sometimes I really think that his huge brain is\ngoing a little mad in its old age. For now we flaunt ourselves before the\npublic. We have our breakfast on a balconyon a balcony, if you\npleaseoverlooking Leicester Square.\n\nAnd what do the people say? asked Syme.\n\nIts quite simple what they say, answered his guide. They say we are a lot\nof jolly gentlemen who pretend they are anarchists.\n\nIt seems to me a very clever idea, said Syme.\n\nClever! God blast your impudence! Clever! cried out the other in a sudden,\nshrill voice which was as startling and discordant as his crooked smile. When\nyouve seen Sunday for a split second youll leave off calling him clever.\n\nWith this they emerged out of a narrow street, and saw the early sunlight\nfilling Leicester Square. It will never be known, I suppose, why this square\nitself should look so alien and in some ways so continental. It will never be\nknown whether it was the foreign look that attracted the foreigners or the\nforeigners who gave it the foreign look. But on this particular morning the\neffect seemed singularly bright and clear. Between the open square and the\nsunlit leaves and the statue and the Saracenic outlines of the Alhambra, it\nlooked the replica of some French or even Spanish public place. And this\neffect increased in Syme the sensation, which in many shapes he had had\nthrough the whole adventure, the eerie sensation of having strayed into a new\nworld. As a fact, he had bought bad cigars round Leicester Square ever since\nhe was a boy. But as he turned that corner, and saw the trees and the Moorish\ncupolas, he could have sworn that he was turning into an unknown Place de\nsomething or other in some foreign town.\n\nAt one corner of the square there projected a kind of angle of a prosperous\nbut quiet hotel, the bulk of which belonged to a street behind. In the wall\nthere was one large French window, probably the window of a large coffee-room;\nand outside this window, almost literally overhanging the square, was a\nformidably buttressed balcony, big enough to contain a dining-table. In fact,\nit did contain a dining-table, or more strictly a breakfast-table; and round\nthe breakfast-table, glowing in the sunlight and evident to the street, were a\ngroup of noisy and talkative men, all dressed in the insolence of fashion,\nwith white waistcoats and expensive button-holes. Some of their jokes could\nalmost be heard across the square. Then the grave Secretary gave his unnatural\nsmile, and Syme knew that this boisterous breakfast party was the secret\nconclave of the European Dynamiters.\n\nThen, as Syme continued to stare at them, he saw something that he had not\nseen before. He had not seen it literally because it was too large to see. At\nthe nearest end of the balcony, blocking up a great part of the perspective,\nwas the back of a great mountain of a man. When Syme had seen him, his first\nthought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone. His\nvastness did not lie only in the fact that he was abnormally tall and quite\nincredibly fat. This man was planned enormously in his original proportions,\nlike a statue carved deliberately as colossal. His head, crowned with white\nhair, as seen from behind looked bigger than a head ought to be. The ears that\nstood out from it looked larger than human ears. He was enlarged terribly to\nscale; and this sense of size was so staggering, that when Syme saw him all\nthe other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish. They\nwere still sitting there as before with their flowers and frock-coats, but now\nit looked as if the big man was entertaining five children to tea.\n\nAs Syme and the guide approached the side door of the hotel, a waiter came out\nsmiling with every tooth in his head.\n\nThe gentlemen are up there, sare, he said. They do talk and they do laugh\nat what they talk. They do say they will throw bombs at ze king.\n\nAnd the waiter hurried away with a napkin over his arm, much pleased with the\nsingular frivolity of the gentlemen upstairs.\n\nThe two men mounted the stairs in silence.\n\nSyme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled\nand broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe.\nHe knew it was so, with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty. Syme,\nindeed, was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless\npsychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health.\nUtterly devoid of fear in physical dangers, he was a great deal too sensitive\nto the smell of spiritual evil. Twice already that night little unmeaning\nthings had peeped out at him almost pruriently, and given him a sense of\ndrawing nearer and nearer to the head-quarters of hell. And this sense became\noverpowering as he drew nearer to the great President.\n\nThe form it took was a childish and yet hateful fancy. As he walked across the\ninner room towards the balcony, the large face of Sunday grew larger and\nlarger; and Syme was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face\nwould be too big to be possible, and that he would scream aloud. He remembered\nthat as a child he would not look at the mask of Memnon in the British Museum,\nbecause it was a face, and so large.\n\nBy an effort, braver than that of leaping over a cliff, he went to an empty\nseat at the breakfast-table and sat down. The men greeted him with good-\nhumoured raillery as if they had always known him. He sobered himself a little\nby looking at their conventional coats and solid, shining coffee-pot; then he\nlooked again at Sunday. His face was very large, but it was still possible to\nhumanity.\n\nIn the presence of the President the whole company looked sufficiently\ncommonplace; nothing about them caught the eye at first, except that by the\nPresidents caprice they had been dressed up with a festive respectability,\nwhich gave the meal the look of a wedding breakfast. One man indeed stood out\nat even a superficial glance. He at least was the common or garden Dynamiter.\nHe wore, indeed, the high white collar and satin tie that were the uniform of\nthe occasion; but out of this collar there sprang a head quite unmanageable\nand quite unmistakable, a bewildering bush of brown hair and beard that almost\nobscured the eyes like those of a Skye terrier. But the eyes did look out of\nthe tangle, and they were the sad eyes of some Russian serf. The effect of\nthis figure was not terrible like that of the President, but it had every\ndiablerie that can come from the utterly grotesque. If out of that stiff tie\nand collar there had come abruptly the head of a cat or a dog, it could not\nhave been a more idiotic contrast.\n\nThe mans name, it seemed, was Gogol; he was a Pole, and in this circle of\ndays he was called Tuesday. His soul and speech were incurably tragic; he\ncould not force himself to play the prosperous and frivolous part demanded of\nhim by President Sunday. And, indeed, when Syme came in the President, with\nthat daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy, was actually\nchaffing Gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces.\n\nOur friend Tuesday, said the President in a deep voice at once of quietude\nand volume, our friend Tuesday doesnt seem to grasp the idea. He dresses up\nlike a gentleman, but he seems to be too great a soul to behave like one. He\ninsists on the ways of the stage conspirator. Now if a gentleman goes about\nLondon in a top hat and a frock-coat, no one need know that he is an\nanarchist. But if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock-coat, and then\ngoes about on his hands and kneeswell, he may attract attention. Thats what\nBrother Gogol does. He goes about on his hands and knees with such\ninexhaustible diplomacy, that by this time he finds it quite difficult to walk\nupright.\n\nI am not good at concealment, said Gogol sulkily, with a thick foreign\naccent; I am not ashamed of the cause.\n\nYes you are, my boy, and so is the cause of you, said the President good-\nnaturedly. You hide as much as anybody; but you cant do it, you see, youre\nsuch an ass! You try to combine two inconsistent methods. When a householder\nfinds a man under his bed, he will probably pause to note the circumstance.\nBut if he finds a man under his bed in a top hat, you will agree with me, my\ndear Tuesday, that he is not likely even to forget it. Now when you were found\nunder Admiral Biffins bed\n\nI am not good at deception, said Tuesday gloomily, flushing.\n\nRight, my boy, right, said the President with a ponderous heartiness, you\narent good at anything.\n\nWhile this stream of conversation continued, Syme was looking more steadily at\nthe men around him. As he did so, he gradually felt all his sense of something\nspiritually queer return.\n\nHe had thought at first that they were all of common stature and costume, with\nthe evident exception of the hairy Gogol. But as he looked at the others, he\nbegan to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river,\na demoniac detail somewhere. That lop-sided laugh, which would suddenly\ndisfigure the fine face of his original guide, was typical of all these types.\nEach man had something about him, perceived perhaps at the tenth or twentieth\nglance, which was not normal, and which seemed hardly human. The only metaphor\nhe could think of was this, that they all looked as men of fashion and\npresence would look, with the additional twist given in a false and curved\nmirror.\n\nOnly the individual examples will express this half-concealed eccentricity.\nSymes original cicerone bore the title of Monday; he was the Secretary of the\nCouncil, and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything,\nexcept the Presidents horrible, happy laughter. But now that Syme had more\nspace and light to observe him, there were other touches. His fine face was so\nemaciated, that Syme thought it must be wasted with some disease; yet somehow\nthe very distress of his dark eyes denied this. It was no physical ill that\ntroubled him. His eyes were alive with intellectual torture, as if pure\nthought was pain.\n\nHe was typical of each of the tribe; each man was subtly and differently\nwrong. Next to him sat Tuesday, the tousle-headed Gogol, a man more obviously\nmad. Next was Wednesday, a certain Marquis de St. Eustache, a sufficiently\ncharacteristic figure. The first few glances found nothing unusual about him,\nexcept that he was the only man at table who wore the fashionable clothes as\nif they were really his own. He had a black French beard cut square and a\nblack English frock-coat cut even squarer. But Syme, sensitive to such things,\nfelt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him, a rich\natmosphere that suffocated. It reminded one irrationally of drowsy odours and\nof dying lamps in the darker poems of Byron and Poe. With this went a sense of\nhis being clad, not in lighter colours, but in softer materials; his black\nseemed richer and warmer than the black shades about him, as if it were\ncompounded of profound colour. His black coat looked as if it were only black\nby being too dense a purple. His black beard looked as if it were only black\nby being too deep a blue. And in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark\nred mouth showed sensual and scornful. Whatever he was he was not a Frenchman;\nhe might be a Jew; he might be something deeper yet in the dark heart of the\nEast. In the bright coloured Persian tiles and pictures showing tyrants\nhunting, you may see just those almond eyes, those blue-black beards, those\ncruel, crimson lips.\n\nThen came Syme, and next a very old man, Professor de Worms, who still kept\nthe chair of Friday, though every day it was expected that his death would\nleave it empty. Save for his intellect, he was in the last dissolution of\nsenile decay. His face was as grey as his long grey beard, his forehead was\nlifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair. In no other case, not\neven that of Gogol, did the bridegroom brilliancy of the morning dress express\na more painful contrast. For the red flower in his button-hole showed up\nagainst a face that was literally discoloured like lead; the whole hideous\neffect was as if some drunken dandies had put their clothes upon a corpse.\nWhen he rose or sat down, which was with long labour and peril, something\nworse was expressed than mere weakness, something indefinably connected with\nthe horror of the whole scene. It did not express decrepitude merely, but\ncorruption. Another hateful fancy crossed Symes quivering mind. He could not\nhelp thinking that whenever the man moved a leg or arm might fall off.\n\nRight at the end sat the man called Saturday, the simplest and the most\nbaffling of all. He was a short, square man with a dark, square face clean-\nshaven, a medical practitioner going by the name of Bull. He had that\ncombination of savoir-faire with a sort of well-groomed coarseness which is\nnot uncommon in young doctors. He carried his fine clothes with confidence\nrather than ease, and he mostly wore a set smile. There was nothing whatever\nodd about him, except that he wore a pair of dark, almost opaque spectacles.\nIt may have been merely a crescendo of nervous fancy that had gone before, but\nthose black discs were dreadful to Syme; they reminded him of half-remembered\nugly tales, of some story about pennies being put on the eyes of the dead.\nSymes eye always caught the black glasses and the blind grin. Had the dying\nProfessor worn them, or even the pale Secretary, they would have been\nappropriate. But on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma.\nThey took away the key of the face. You could not tell what his smile or his\ngravity meant. Partly from this, and partly because he had a vulgar virility\nwanting in most of the others it seemed to Syme that he might be the wickedest\nof all those wicked men. Syme even had the thought that his eyes might be\ncovered up because they were too frightful to see.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VI. THE EXPOSURE\n\nSUCH were the six men who had sworn to destroy the world. Again and again Syme\nstrove to pull together his common sense in their presence. Sometimes he saw\nfor an instant that these notions were subjective, that he was only looking at\nordinary men, one of whom was old, another nervous, another short-sighted. The\nsense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again. Each figure\nseemed to be, somehow, on the borderland of things, just as their theory was\non the borderland of thought. He knew that each one of these men stood at the\nextreme end, so to speak, of some wild road of reasoning. He could only fancy,\nas in some old-world fable, that if a man went westward to the end of the\nworld he would find somethingsay a treethat was more or less than a tree, a\ntree possessed by a spirit; and that if he went east to the end of the world\nhe would find something else that was not wholly itselfa tower, perhaps, of\nwhich the very shape was wicked. So these figures seemed to stand up, violent\nand unaccountable, against an ultimate horizon, visions from the verge. The\nends of the earth were closing in.\n\nTalk had been going on steadily as he took in the scene; and not the least of\nthe contrasts of that bewildering breakfast-table was the contrast between the\neasy and unobtrusive tone of talk and its terrible purport. They were deep in\nthe discussion of an actual and immediate plot. The waiter downstairs had\nspoken quite correctly when he said that they were talking about bombs and\nkings. Only three days afterwards the Czar was to meet the President of the\nFrench Republic in Paris, and over their bacon and eggs upon their sunny\nbalcony these beaming gentlemen had decided how both should die. Even the\ninstrument was chosen; the black-bearded Marquis, it appeared, was to carry\nthe bomb.\n\nOrdinarily speaking, the proximity of this positive and objective crime would\nhave sobered Syme, and cured him of all his merely mystical tremors. He would\nhave thought of nothing but the need of saving at least two human bodies from\nbeing ripped in pieces with iron and roaring gas. But the truth was that by\nthis time he had begun to feel a third kind of fear, more piercing and\npractical than either his moral revulsion or his social responsibility. Very\nsimply, he had no fear to spare for the French President or the Czar; he had\nbegun to fear for himself. Most of the talkers took little heed of him,\ndebating now with their faces closer together, and almost uniformly grave,\nsave when for an instant the smile of the Secretary ran aslant across his face\nas the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky. But there was one\npersistent thing which first troubled Syme and at last terrified him. The\nPresident was always looking at him, steadily, and with a great and baffling\ninterest. The enormous man was quite quiet, but his blue eyes stood out of his\nhead. And they were always fixed on Syme.\n\nSyme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony. When the Presidents\neyes were on him he felt as if he were made of glass. He had hardly the shred\nof a doubt that in some silent and extraordinary way Sunday had found out that\nhe was a spy. He looked over the edge of the balcony, and saw a policeman,\nstanding abstractedly just beneath, staring at the bright railings and the\nsunlit trees.\n\nThen there fell upon him the great temptation that was to torment him for many\ndays. In the presence of these powerful and repulsive men, who were the\nprinces of anarchy, he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of\nthe poet Gregory, the mere aesthete of anarchism. He even thought of him now\nwith an old kindness, as if they had played together when children. But he\nremembered that he was still tied to Gregory by a great promise. He had\npromised never to do the very thing that he now felt himself almost in the act\nof doing. He had promised not to jump over that balcony and speak to that\npoliceman. He took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade. His soul\nswayed in a vertigo of moral indecision. He had only to snap the thread of a\nrash vow made to a villainous society, and all his life could be as open and\nsunny as the square beneath him. He had, on the other hand, only to keep his\nantiquated honour, and be delivered inch by inch into the power of this great\nenemy of mankind, whose very intellect was a torture-chamber. Whenever he\nlooked down into the square he saw the comfortable policeman, a pillar of\ncommon sense and common order. Whenever he looked back at the breakfast-table\nhe saw the President still quietly studying him with big, unbearable eyes.\n\nIn all the torrent of his thought there were two thoughts that never crossed\nhis mind. First, it never occurred to him to doubt that the President and his\nCouncil could crush him if he continued to stand alone. The place might be\npublic, the project might seem impossible. But Sunday was not the man who\nwould carry himself thus easily without having, somehow or somewhere, set open\nhis iron trap. Either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident, by\nhypnotism or by fire from hell, Sunday could certainly strike him. If he\ndefied the man he was probably dead, either struck stiff there in his chair or\nlong afterwards as by an innocent ailment. If he called in the police\npromptly, arrested everyone, told all, and set against them the whole energy\nof England, he would probably escape; certainly not otherwise. They were a\nbalconyful of gentlemen overlooking a bright and busy square; but he felt no\nmore safe with them than if they had been a boatful of armed pirates\noverlooking an empty sea.\n\nThere was a second thought that never came to him. It never occurred to him to\nbe spiritually won over to the enemy. Many moderns, inured to a weak worship\nof intellect and force, might have wavered in their allegiance under this\noppression of a great personality. They might have called Sunday the super-\nman. If any such creature be conceivable, he looked, indeed, somewhat like it,\nwith his earth-shaking abstraction, as of a stone statue walking. He might\nhave been called something above man, with his large plans, which were too\nobvious to be detected, with his large face, which was too frank to be\nunderstood. But this was a kind of modern meanness to which Syme could not\nsink even in his extreme morbidity. Like any man, he was coward enough to fear\ngreat force; but he was not quite coward enough to admire it.\n\nThe men were eating as they talked, and even in this they were typical. Dr.\nBull and the Marquis ate casually and conventionally of the best things on the\ntablecold pheasant or Strasbourg pie. But the Secretary was a vegetarian, and\nhe spoke earnestly of the projected murder over half a raw tomato and three\nquarters of a glass of tepid water. The old Professor had such slops as\nsuggested a sickening second childhood. And even in this President Sunday\npreserved his curious predominance of mere mass. For he ate like twenty men;\nhe ate incredibly, with a frightful freshness of appetite, so that it was like\nwatching a sausage factory. Yet continually, when he had swallowed a dozen\ncrumpets or drunk a quart of coffee, he would be found with his great head on\none side staring at Syme.\n\nI have often wondered, said the Marquis, taking a great bite out of a slice\nof bread and jam, whether it wouldnt be better for me to do it with a knife.\nMost of the best things have been brought off with a knife. And it would be a\nnew emotion to get a knife into a French President and wriggle it round.\n\nYou are wrong, said the Secretary, drawing his black brows together. The\nknife was merely the expression of the old personal quarrel with a personal\ntyrant. Dynamite is not only our best tool, but our best symbol. It is as\nperfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the Christians. It\nexpands; it only destroys because it broadens; even so, thought only destroys\nbecause it broadens. A mans brain is a bomb, he cried out, loosening\nsuddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with violence. My\nbrain feels like a bomb, night and day. It must expand! It must expand! A\nmans brain must expand, if it breaks up the universe.\n\nI dont want the universe broken up just yet, drawled the Marquis. I want\nto do a lot of beastly things before I die. I thought of one yesterday in\nbed.\n\nNo, if the only end of the thing is nothing, said Dr. Bull with his sphinx-\nlike smile, it hardly seems worth doing.\n\nThe old Professor was staring at the ceiling with dull eyes.\n\nEvery man knows in his heart, he said, that nothing is worth doing.\n\nThere was a singular silence, and then the Secretary said\n\nWe are wandering, however, from the point. The only question is how Wednesday\nis to strike the blow. I take it we should all agree with the original notion\nof a bomb. As to the actual arrangements, I should suggest that tomorrow\nmorning he should go first of all to\n\nThe speech was broken off short under a vast shadow. President Sunday had\nrisen to his feet, seeming to fill the sky above them.\n\nBefore we discuss that, he said in a small, quiet voice, let us go into a\nprivate room. I have something very particular to say.\n\nSyme stood up before any of the others. The instant of choice had come at\nlast, the pistol was at his head. On the pavement before he could hear the\npoliceman idly stir and stamp, for the morning, though bright, was cold.\n\nA barrel-organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune.\nSyme stood up taut, as if it had been a bugle before the battle. He found\nhimself filled with a supernatural courage that came from nowhere. That\njingling music seemed full of the vivacity, the vulgarity, and the irrational\nvalour of the poor, who in all those unclean streets were all clinging to the\ndecencies and the charities of Christendom. His youthful prank of being a\npoliceman had faded from his mind; he did not think of himself as the\nrepresentative of the corps of gentlemen turned into fancy constables, or of\nthe old eccentric who lived in the dark room. But he did feel himself as the\nambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street, who every day\nmarched into battle to the music of the barrel-organ. And this high pride in\nbeing human had lifted him unaccountably to an infinite height above the\nmonstrous men around him. For an instant, at least, he looked down upon all\ntheir sprawling eccentricities from the starry pinnacle of the commonplace. He\nfelt towards them all that unconscious and elementary superiority that a brave\nman feels over powerful beasts or a wise man over powerful errors. He knew\nthat he had neither the intellectual nor the physical strength of President\nSunday; but in that moment he minded it no more than the fact that he had not\nthe muscles of a tiger or a horn on his nose like a rhinoceros. All was\nswallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the President was wrong and that\nthe barrel-organ was right. There clanged in his mind that unanswerable and\nterrible truism in the song of Roland\n\n    \n    \r\n        Pagens ont tort et Chretiens ont droit.\r\n     \n\nwhich in the old nasal French has the clang and groan of great iron. This\nliberation of his spirit from the load of his weakness went with a quite clear\ndecision to embrace death. If the people of the barrel-organ could keep their\nold-world obligations, so could he. This very pride in keeping his word was\nthat he was keeping it to miscreants. It was his last triumph over these\nlunatics to go down into their dark room and die for something that they could\nnot even understand. The barrel-organ seemed to give the marching tune with\nthe energy and the mingled noises of a whole orchestra; and he could hear deep\nand rolling, under all the trumpets of the pride of life, the drums of the\npride of death.\n\nThe conspirators were already filing through the open window and into the\nrooms behind. Syme went last, outwardly calm, but with all his brain and body\nthrobbing with romantic rhythm. The President led them down an irregular side\nstair, such as might be used by servants, and into a dim, cold, empty room,\nwith a table and benches, like an abandoned boardroom. When they were all in,\nhe closed and locked the door.\n\nThe first to speak was Gogol, the irreconcilable, who seemed bursting with\ninarticulate grievance.\n\nZso! Zso! he cried, with an obscure excitement, his heavy Polish accent\nbecoming almost impenetrable. You zay you nod ide. You zay you show\nhimselves. It is all nuzzinks. Ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves\nin a dark box!\n\nThe President seemed to take the foreigners incoherent satire with entire\ngood humour.\n\nYou cant get hold of it yet, Gogol, he said in a fatherly way. When once\nthey have heard us talking nonsense on that balcony they will not care where\nwe go afterwards. If we had come here first, we should have had the whole\nstaff at the keyhole. You dont seem to know anything about mankind.\n\nI die for zem, cried the Pole in thick excitement, and I slay zare\noppressors. I care not for these games of gonzealment. I would zmite ze tyrant\nin ze open square.\n\nI see, I see, said the President, nodding kindly as he seated himself at the\ntop of a long table. You die for mankind first, and then you get up and smite\ntheir oppressors. So thats all right. And now may I ask you to control your\nbeautiful sentiments, and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table. For\nthe first time this morning something intelligent is going to be said.\n\nSyme, with the perturbed promptitude he had shown since the original summons,\nsat down first. Gogol sat down last, grumbling in his brown beard about\ngombromise. No one except Syme seemed to have any notion of the blow that was\nabout to fall. As for him, he had merely the feeling of a man mounting the\nscaffold with the intention, at any rate, of making a good speech.\n\nComrades, said the President, suddenly rising, we have spun out this farce\nlong enough. I have called you down here to tell you something so simple and\nshocking that even the waiters upstairs (long inured to our levities) might\nhear some new seriousness in my voice. Comrades, we were discussing plans and\nnaming places. I propose, before saying anything else, that those plans and\nplaces should not be voted by this meeting, but should be left wholly in the\ncontrol of some one reliable member. I suggest Comrade Saturday, Dr. Bull.\n\nThey all stared at him; then they all started in their seats, for the next\nwords, though not loud, had a living and sensational emphasis. Sunday struck\nthe table.\n\nNot one word more about the plans and places must be said at this meeting.\nNot one tiny detail more about what we mean to do must be mentioned in this\ncompany.\n\nSunday had spent his life in astonishing his followers; but it seemed as if he\nhad never really astonished them until now. They all moved feverishly in their\nseats, except Syme. He sat stiff in his, with his hand in his pocket, and on\nthe handle of his loaded revolver. When the attack on him came he would sell\nhis life dear. He would find out at least if the President was mortal.\n\nSunday went on smoothly\n\nYou will probably understand that there is only one possible motive for\nforbidding free speech at this festival of freedom. Strangers overhearing us\nmatters nothing. They assume that we are joking. But what would matter, even\nunto death, is this, that there should be one actually among us who is not of\nus, who knows our grave purpose, but does not share it, who\n\nThe Secretary screamed out suddenly like a woman.\n\nIt cant be! he cried, leaping. There cant\n\nThe President flapped his large flat hand on the table like the fin of some\nhuge fish.\n\nYes, he said slowly, there is a spy in this room. There is a traitor at\nthis table. I will waste no more words. His name\n\nSyme half rose from his seat, his finger firm on the trigger.\n\nHis name is Gogol, said the President. He is that hairy humbug over there\nwho pretends to be a Pole.\n\nGogol sprang to his feet, a pistol in each hand. With the same flash three men\nsprang at his throat. Even the Professor made an effort to rise. But Syme saw\nlittle of the scene, for he was blinded with a beneficent darkness; he had\nsunk down into his seat shuddering, in a palsy of passionate relief.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VII. THE UNACCOUNTABLE CONDUCT OF PROFESSOR DE WORMS\n\nSIT down! said Sunday in a voice that he used once or twice in his life, a\nvoice that made men drop drawn swords.\n\nThe three who had risen fell away from Gogol, and that equivocal person\nhimself resumed his seat.\n\nWell, my man, said the President briskly, addressing him as one addresses a\ntotal stranger, will you oblige me by putting your hand in your upper\nwaistcoat pocket and showing me what you have there?\n\nThe alleged Pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair, but he put\ntwo fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip\nof card. When Syme saw it lying on the table, he woke up again to the world\noutside him. For although the card lay at the other extreme of the table, and\nhe could read nothing of the inscription on it, it bore a startling\nresemblance to the blue card in his own pocket, the card which had been given\nto him when he joined the anti-anarchist constabulary.\n\nPathetic Slav, said the President, tragic child of Poland, are you prepared\nin the presence of that card to deny that you are in this companyshall we say\nde trop?\n\nRight oh! said the late Gogol. It made everyone jump to hear a clear,\ncommercial and somewhat cockney voice coming out of that forest of foreign\nhair. It was irrational, as if a Chinaman had suddenly spoken with a Scotch\naccent.\n\nI gather that you fully understand your position, said Sunday.\n\nYou bet, answered the Pole. I see its a fair cop. All I say is, I dont\nbelieve any Pole could have imitated my accent like I did his.\n\nI concede the point, said Sunday. I believe your own accent to be\ninimitable, though I shall practise it in my bath. Do you mind leaving your\nbeard with your card?\n\nNot a bit, answered Gogol; and with one finger he ripped off the whole of\nhis shaggy head-covering, emerging with thin red hair and a pale, pert face.\nIt was hot, he added.\n\nI will do you the justice to say, said Sunday, not without a sort of brutal\nadmiration, that you seem to have kept pretty cool under it. Now listen to\nme. I like you. The consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two\nand a half minutes if I heard that you had died in torments. Well, if you ever\ntell the police or any human soul about us, I shall have that two and a half\nminutes of discomfort. On your discomfort I will not dwell. Good day. Mind the\nstep.\n\nThe red-haired detective who had masqueraded as Gogol rose to his feet without\na word, and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance. Yet the\nastonished Syme was able to realise that this ease was suddenly assumed; for\nthere was a slight stumble outside the door, which showed that the departing\ndetective had not minded the step.\n\nTime is flying, said the President in his gayest manner, after glancing at\nhis watch, which like everything about him seemed bigger than it ought to be.\nI must go off at once; I have to take the chair at a Humanitarian meeting.\n\nThe Secretary turned to him with working eyebrows.\n\nWould it not be better, he said a little sharply, to discuss further the\ndetails of our project, now that the spy has left us?\n\nNo, I think not, said the President with a yawn like an unobtrusive\nearthquake. Leave it as it is. Let Saturday settle it. I must be off.\nBreakfast here next Sunday.\n\nBut the late loud scenes had whipped up the almost naked nerves of the\nSecretary. He was one of those men who are conscientious even in crime.\n\nI must protest, President, that the thing is irregular, he said. It is a\nfundamental rule of our society that all plans shall be debated in full\ncouncil. Of course, I fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual\npresence of a traitor\n\nSecretary, said the President seriously, if youd take your head home and\nboil it for a turnip it might be useful. I cant say. But it might.\n\nThe Secretary reared back in a kind of equine anger.\n\nI really fail to understand he began in high offense.\n\nThats it, thats it, said the President, nodding a great many times.\nThats where you fail right enough. You fail to understand. Why, you dancing\ndonkey, he roared, rising, you didnt want to be overheard by a spy, didnt\nyou? How do you know you arent overheard now?\n\nAnd with these words he shouldered his way out of the room, shaking with\nincomprehensible scorn.\n\nFour of the men left behind gaped after him without any apparent glimmering of\nhis meaning. Syme alone had even a glimmering, and such as it was it froze him\nto the bone. If the last words of the President meant anything, they meant\nthat he had not after all passed unsuspected. They meant that while Sunday\ncould not denounce him like Gogol, he still could not trust him like the\nothers.\n\nThe other four got to their feet grumbling more or less, and betook themselves\nelsewhere to find lunch, for it was already well past midday. The Professor\nwent last, very slowly and painfully. Syme sat long after the rest had gone,\nrevolving his strange position. He had escaped a thunderbolt, but he was still\nunder a cloud. At last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into\nLeicester Square. The bright, cold day had grown increasingly colder, and when\nhe came out into the street he was surprised by a few flakes of snow. While he\nstill carried the sword-stick and the rest of Gregorys portable luggage, he\nhad thrown the cloak down and left it somewhere, perhaps on the steam-tug,\nperhaps on the balcony. Hoping, therefore, that the snow-shower might be\nslight, he stepped back out of the street for a moment and stood up under the\ndoorway of a small and greasy hair-dressers shop, the front window of which\nwas empty, except for a sickly wax lady in evening dress.\n\nSnow, however, began to thicken and fall fast; and Syme, having found one\nglance at the wax lady quite sufficient to depress his spirits, stared out\ninstead into the white and empty street. He was considerably astonished to\nsee, standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window, a man.\nHis top hat was loaded with snow like the hat of Father Christmas, the white\ndrift was rising round his boots and ankles; but it seemed as if nothing could\ntear him away from the contemplation of the colourless wax doll in dirty\nevening dress. That any human being should stand in such weather looking into\nsuch a shop was a matter of sufficient wonder to Syme; but his idle wonder\nturned suddenly into a personal shock; for he realised that the man standing\nthere was the paralytic old Professor de Worms. It scarcely seemed the place\nfor a person of his years and infirmities.\n\nSyme was ready to believe anything about the perversions of this dehumanized\nbrotherhood; but even he could not believe that the Professor had fallen in\nlove with that particular wax lady. He could only suppose that the mans\nmalady (whatever it was) involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance.\nHe was not inclined, however, to feel in this case any very compassionate\nconcern. On the contrary, he rather congratulated himself that the Professors\nstroke and his elaborate and limping walk would make it easy to escape from\nhim and leave him miles behind. For Syme thirsted first and last to get clear\nof the whole poisonous atmosphere, if only for an hour. Then he could collect\nhis thoughts, formulate his policy, and decide finally whether he should or\nshould not keep faith with Gregory.\n\nHe strolled away through the dancing snow, turned up two or three streets,\ndown through two or three others, and entered a small Soho restaurant for\nlunch. He partook reflectively of four small and quaint courses, drank half a\nbottle of red wine, and ended up over black coffee and a black cigar, still\nthinking. He had taken his seat in the upper room of the restaurant, which was\nfull of the chink of knives and the chatter of foreigners. He remembered that\nin old days he had imagined that all these harmless and kindly aliens were\nanarchists. He shuddered, remembering the real thing. But even the shudder had\nthe delightful shame of escape. The wine, the common food, the familiar place,\nthe faces of natural and talkative men, made him almost feel as if the Council\nof the Seven Days had been a bad dream; and although he knew it was\nnevertheless an objective reality, it was at least a distant one. Tall houses\nand populous streets lay between him and his last sight of the shameful seven;\nhe was free in free London, and drinking wine among the free. With a somewhat\neasier action, he took his hat and stick and strolled down the stair into the\nshop below.\n\nWhen he entered that lower room he stood stricken and rooted to the spot. At a\nsmall table, close up to the blank window and the white street of snow, sat\nthe old anarchist Professor over a glass of milk, with his lifted livid face\nand pendent eyelids. For an instant Syme stood as rigid as the stick he leant\nupon. Then with a gesture as of blind hurry, he brushed past the Professor,\ndashing open the door and slamming it behind him, and stood outside in the\nsnow.\n\nCan that old corpse be following me? he asked himself, biting his yellow\nmoustache. I stopped too long up in that room, so that even such leaden feet\ncould catch me up. One comfort is, with a little brisk walking I can put a man\nlike that as far away as Timbuctoo. Or am I too fanciful? Was he really\nfollowing me? Surely Sunday would not be such a fool as to send a lame man?\n\nHe set off at a smart pace, twisting and whirling his stick, in the direction\nof Covent Garden. As he crossed the great market the snow increased, growing\nblinding and bewildering as the afternoon began to darken. The snow-flakes\ntormented him like a swarm of silver bees. Getting into his eyes and beard,\nthey added their unremitting futility to his already irritated nerves; and by\nthe time that he had come at a swinging pace to the beginning of Fleet Street,\nhe lost patience, and finding a Sunday teashop, turned into it to take\nshelter. He ordered another cup of black coffee as an excuse. Scarcely had he\ndone so, when Professor de Worms hobbled heavily into the shop, sat down with\ndifficulty and ordered a glass of milk.\n\nSymes walking-stick had fallen from his hand with a great clang, which\nconfessed the concealed steel. But the Professor did not look round. Syme, who\nwas commonly a cool character, was literally gaping as a rustic gapes at a\nconjuring trick. He had seen no cab following; he had heard no wheels outside\nthe shop; to all mortal appearances the man had come on foot. But the old man\ncould only walk like a snail, and Syme had walked like the wind. He started up\nand snatched his stick, half crazy with the contradiction in mere arithmetic,\nand swung out of the swinging doors, leaving his coffee untasted. An omnibus\ngoing to the Bank went rattling by with an unusual rapidity. He had a violent\nrun of a hundred yards to reach it; but he managed to spring, swaying upon the\nsplash-board and, pausing for an instant to pant, he climbed on to the top.\nWhen he had been seated for about half a minute, he heard behind him a sort of\nheavy and asthmatic breathing.\n\nTurning sharply, he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus\nsteps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow, and under the shadow of its\nbrim the short-sighted face and shaky shoulders of Professor de Worms. He let\nhimself into a seat with characteristic care, and wrapped himself up to the\nchin in the mackintosh rug.\n\nEvery movement of the old mans tottering figure and vague hands, every\nuncertain gesture and panic-stricken pause, seemed to put it beyond question\nthat he was helpless, that he was in the last imbecility of the body. He moved\nby inches, he let himself down with little gasps of caution. And yet, unless\nthe philosophical entities called time and space have no vestige even of a\npractical existence, it appeared quite unquestionable that he had run after\nthe omnibus.\n\nSyme sprang erect upon the rocking car, and after staring wildly at the wintry\nsky, that grew gloomier every moment, he ran down the steps. He had repressed\nan elemental impulse to leap over the side.\n\nToo bewildered to look back or to reason, he rushed into one of the little\ncourts at the side of Fleet Street as a rabbit rushes into a hole. He had a\nvague idea, if this incomprehensible old Jack-in-the-box was really pursuing\nhim, that in that labyrinth of little streets he could soon throw him off the\nscent. He dived in and out of those crooked lanes, which were more like cracks\nthan thoroughfares; and by the time that he had completed about twenty\nalternate angles and described an unthinkable polygon, he paused to listen for\nany sound of pursuit. There was none; there could not in any case have been\nmuch, for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow. Somewhere\nbehind Red Lion Court, however, he noticed a place where some energetic\ncitizen had cleared away the snow for a space of about twenty yards, leaving\nthe wet, glistening cobble-stones. He thought little of this as he passed it,\nonly plunging into yet another arm of the maze. But when a few hundred yards\nfarther on he stood still again to listen, his heart stood still also, for he\nheard from that space of rugged stones the clinking crutch and labouring feet\nof the infernal cripple.\n\nThe sky above was loaded with the clouds of snow, leaving London in a darkness\nand oppression premature for that hour of the evening. On each side of Syme\nthe walls of the alley were blind and featureless; there was no little window\nor any kind of eve. He felt a new impulse to break out of this hive of houses,\nand to get once more into the open and lamp-lit street. Yet he rambled and\ndodged for a long time before he struck the main thoroughfare. When he did so,\nhe struck it much farther up than he had fancied. He came out into what seemed\nthe vast and void of Ludgate Circus, and saw St. Pauls Cathedral sitting in\nthe sky.\n\nAt first he was startled to find these great roads so empty, as if a\npestilence had swept through the city. Then he told himself that some degree\nof emptiness was natural; first because the snow-storm was even dangerously\ndeep, and secondly because it was Sunday. And at the very word Sunday he bit\nhis lip; the word was henceforth for hire like some indecent pun. Under the\nwhite fog of snow high up in the heaven the whole atmosphere of the city was\nturned to a very queer kind of green twilight, as of men under the sea. The\nsealed and sullen sunset behind the dark dome of St. Pauls had in it smoky\nand sinister colourscolours of sickly green, dead red or decaying bronze,\nthat were just bright enough to emphasise the solid whiteness of the snow. But\nright up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral;\nand upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow,\nstill clinging as to an Alpine peak. It had fallen accidentally, but just so\nfallen as to half drape the dome from its very topmost point, and to pick out\nin perfect silver the great orb and the cross. When Syme saw it he suddenly\nstraightened himself, and made with his sword-stick an involuntary salute.\n\nHe knew that that evil figure, his shadow, was creeping quickly or slowly\nbehind him, and he did not care.\n\nIt seemed a symbol of human faith and valour that while the skies were\ndarkening that high place of the earth was bright. The devils might have\ncaptured heaven, but they had not yet captured the cross. He had a new impulse\nto tear out the secret of this dancing, jumping and pursuing paralytic; and at\nthe entrance of the court as it opened upon the Circus he turned, stick in\nhand, to face his pursuer.\n\nProfessor de Worms came slowly round the corner of the irregular alley behind\nhim, his unnatural form outlined against a lonely gas-lamp, irresistibly\nrecalling that very imaginative figure in the nursery rhymes, the crooked man\nwho went a crooked mile. He really looked as if he had been twisted out of\nshape by the tortuous streets he had been threading. He came nearer and\nnearer, the lamplight shining on his lifted spectacles, his lifted, patient\nface. Syme waited for him as St. George waited for the dragon, as a man waits\nfor a final explanation or for death. And the old Professor came right up to\nhim and passed him like a total stranger, without even a blink of his mournful\neyelids.\n\nThere was something in this silent and unexpected innocence that left Syme in\na final fury. The mans colourless face and manner seemed to assert that the\nwhole following had been an accident. Syme was galvanised with an energy that\nwas something between bitterness and a burst of boyish derision. He made a\nwild gesture as if to knock the old mans hat off, called out something like\nCatch me if you can, and went racing away across the white, open Circus.\nConcealment was impossible now; and looking back over his shoulder, he could\nsee the black figure of the old gentleman coming after him with long, swinging\nstrides like a man winning a mile race. But the head upon that bounding body\nwas still pale, grave and professional, like the head of a lecturer upon the\nbody of a harlequin.\n\nThis outrageous chase sped across Ludgate Circus, up Ludgate Hill, round St.\nPauls Cathedral, along Cheapside, Syme remembering all the nightmares he had\never known. Then Syme broke away towards the river, and ended almost down by\nthe docks. He saw the yellow panes of a low, lighted public-house, flung\nhimself into it and ordered beer. It was a foul tavern, sprinkled with foreign\nsailors, a place where opium might be smoked or knives drawn.\n\nA moment later Professor de Worms entered the place, sat down carefully, and\nasked for a glass of milk.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VIII. THE PROFESSOR EXPLAINS\n\nWHEN Gabriel Syme found himself finally established in a chair, and opposite\nto him, fixed and final also, the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the\nProfessor, his fears fully returned. This incomprehensible man from the fierce\ncouncil, after all, had certainly pursued him. If the man had one character as\na paralytic and another character as a pursuer, the antithesis might make him\nmore interesting, but scarcely more soothing. It would be a very small comfort\nthat he could not find the Professor out, if by some serious accident the\nProfessor should find him out. He emptied a whole pewter pot of ale before the\nprofessor had touched his milk.\n\nOne possibility, however, kept him hopeful and yet helpless. It was just\npossible that this escapade signified something other than even a slight\nsuspicion of him. Perhaps it was some regular form or sign. Perhaps the\nfoolish scamper was some sort of friendly signal that he ought to have\nunderstood. Perhaps it was a ritual. Perhaps the new Thursday was always\nchased along Cheapside, as the new Lord Mayor is always escorted along it. He\nwas just selecting a tentative inquiry, when the old Professor opposite\nsuddenly and simply cut him short. Before Syme could ask the first diplomatic\nquestion, the old anarchist had asked suddenly, without any sort of\npreparation\n\nAre you a policeman?\n\nWhatever else Syme had expected, he had never expected anything so brutal and\nactual as this. Even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with\nan air of rather blundering jocularity.\n\nA policeman? he said, laughing vaguely. Whatever made you think of a\npoliceman in connection with me?\n\nThe process was simple enough, answered the Professor patiently. I thought\nyou looked like a policeman. I think so now.\n\nDid I take a policemans hat by mistake out of the restaurant? asked Syme,\nsmiling wildly. Have I by any chance got a number stuck on to me somewhere?\nHave my boots got that watchful look? Why must I be a policeman? Do, do let me\nbe a postman.\n\nThe old Professor shook his head with a gravity that gave no hope, but Syme\nran on with a feverish irony.\n\nBut perhaps I misunderstood the delicacies of your German philosophy. Perhaps\npoliceman is a relative term. In an evolutionary sense, sir, the ape fades so\ngradually into the policeman, that I myself can never detect the shade. The\nmonkey is only the policeman that may be. Perhaps a maiden lady on Clapham\nCommon is only the policeman that might have been. I dont mind being the\npoliceman that might have been. I dont mind being anything in German\nthought.\n\nAre you in the police service? said the old man, ignoring all Symes\nimprovised and desperate raillery. Are you a detective?\n\nSymes heart turned to stone, but his face never changed.\n\nYour suggestion is ridiculous, he began. Why on earth\n\nThe old man struck his palsied hand passionately on the rickety table, nearly\nbreaking it.\n\nDid you hear me ask a plain question, you pattering spy? he shrieked in a\nhigh, crazy voice. Are you, or are you not, a police detective?\n\nNo! answered Syme, like a man standing on the hangmans drop.\n\nYou swear it, said the old man, leaning across to him, his dead face\nbecoming as it were loathsomely alive. You swear it! You swear it! If you\nswear falsely, will you be damned? Will you be sure that the devil dances at\nyour funeral? Will you see that the nightmare sits on your grave? Will there\nreally be no mistake? You are an anarchist, you are a dynamiter! Above all,\nyou are not in any sense a detective? You are not in the British police?\n\nHe leant his angular elbow far across the table, and put up his large loose\nhand like a flap to his ear.\n\nI am not in the British police, said Syme with insane calm.\n\nProfessor de Worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of kindly\ncollapse.\n\nThats a pity, he said, because I am.\n\nSyme sprang up straight, sending back the bench behind him with a crash.\n\nBecause you are what? he said thickly. You are what?\n\nI am a policeman, said the Professor with his first broad smile, and beaming\nthrough his spectacles. But as you think policeman only a relative term, of\ncourse I have nothing to do with you. I am in the British police force; but as\nyou tell me you are not in the British police force, I can only say that I met\nyou in a dynamiters club. I suppose I ought to arrest you. And with these\nwords he laid on the table before Syme an exact facsimile of the blue card\nwhich Syme had in his own waistcoat pocket, the symbol of his power from the\npolice.\n\nSyme had for a flash the sensation that the cosmos had turned exactly upside\ndown, that all trees were growing downwards and that all stars were under his\nfeet. Then came slowly the opposite conviction. For the last twenty-four hours\nthe cosmos had really been upside down, but now the capsized universe had come\nright side up again. This devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only\nan elder brother of his own house, who on the other side of the table lay back\nand laughed at him. He did not for the moment ask any questions of detail; he\nonly knew the happy and silly fact that this shadow, which had pursued him\nwith an intolerable oppression of peril, was only the shadow of a friend\ntrying to catch him up. He knew simultaneously that he was a fool and a free\nman. For with any recovery from morbidity there must go a certain healthy\nhumiliation. There comes a certain point in such conditions when only three\nthings are possible: first a perpetuation of Satanic pride, secondly tears,\nand third laughter. Symes egotism held hard to the first course for a few\nseconds, and then suddenly adopted the third. Taking his own blue police\nticket from his own waist coat pocket, he tossed it on to the table; then he\nflung his head back until his spike of yellow beard almost pointed at the\nceiling, and shouted with a barbaric laughter.\n\nEven in that close den, perpetually filled with the din of knives, plates,\ncans, clamorous voices, sudden struggles and stampedes, there was something\nHomeric in Symes mirth which made many half-drunken men look round.\n\nWhat yer laughing at, guvnor? asked one wondering labourer from the docks.\n\nAt myself, answered Syme, and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic\nreaction.\n\nPull yourself together, said the Professor, or youll get hysterical. Have\nsome more beer. Ill join you.\n\nYou havent drunk your milk, said Syme.\n\nMy milk! said the other, in tones of withering and unfathomable contempt,\nmy milk! Do you think Id look at the beastly stuff when Im out of sight of\nthe bloody anarchists? Were all Christians in this room, though perhaps, he\nadded, glancing around at the reeling crowd, not strict ones. Finish my milk?\nGreat blazes! yes, Ill finish it right enough! and he knocked the tumbler\noff the table, making a crash of glass and a splash of silver fluid.\n\nSyme was staring at him with a happy curiosity.\n\nI understand now, he cried; of course, youre not an old man at all.\n\nI cant take my face off here, replied Professor de Worms. Its rather an\nelaborate make-up. As to whether Im an old man, thats not for me to say. I\nwas thirty-eight last birthday.\n\nYes, but I mean, said Syme impatiently, theres nothing the matter with\nyou.\n\nYes, answered the other dispassionately. I am subject to colds.\n\nSymes laughter at all this had about it a wild weakness of relief. He laughed\nat the idea of the paralytic Professor being really a young actor dressed up\nas if for the foot-lights. But he felt that he would have laughed as loudly if\na pepperpot had fallen over.\n\nThe false Professor drank and wiped his false beard.\n\nDid you know, he asked, that that man Gogol was one of us?\n\nI? No, I didnt know it, answered Syme in some surprise. But didnt you?\n\nI knew no more than the dead, replied the man who called himself de Worms.\nI thought the President was talking about me, and I rattled in my boots.\n\nAnd I thought he was talking about me, said Syme, with his rather reckless\nlaughter. I had my hand on my revolver all the time.\n\nSo had I, said the Professor grimly; so had Gogol evidently.\n\nSyme struck the table with an exclamation.\n\nWhy, there were three of us there! he cried. Three out of seven is a\nfighting number. If we had only known that we were three!\n\nThe face of Professor de Worms darkened, and he did not look up.\n\nWe were three, he said. If we had been three hundred we could still have\ndone nothing.\n\nNot if we were three hundred against four? asked Syme, jeering rather\nboisterously.\n\nNo, said the Professor with sobriety, not if we were three hundred against\nSunday.\n\nAnd the mere name struck Syme cold and serious; his laughter had died in his\nheart before it could die on his lips. The face of the unforgettable President\nsprang into his mind as startling as a coloured photograph, and he remarked\nthis difference between Sunday and all his satellites, that their faces,\nhowever fierce or sinister, became gradually blurred by memory like other\nhuman faces, whereas Sundays seemed almost to grow more actual during\nabsence, as if a mans painted portrait should slowly come alive.\n\nThey were both silent for a measure of moments, and then Symes speech came\nwith a rush, like the sudden foaming of champagne.\n\nProfessor, he cried, it is intolerable. Are you afraid of this man?\n\nThe Professor lifted his heavy lids, and gazed at Syme with large, wide-open,\nblue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty.\n\nYes, I am, he said mildly. So are you.\n\nSyme was dumb for an instant. Then he rose to his feet erect, like an insulted\nman, and thrust the chair away from him.\n\nYes, he said in a voice indescribable, you are right. I am afraid of him.\nTherefore I swear by God that I will seek out this man whom I fear until I\nfind him, and strike him on the mouth. If heaven were his throne and the earth\nhis footstool, I swear that I would pull him down.\n\nHow? asked the staring Professor. Why?\n\nBecause I am afraid of him, said Syme; and no man should leave in the\nuniverse anything of which he is afraid.\n\nDe Worms blinked at him with a sort of blind wonder. He made an effort to\nspeak, but Syme went on in a low voice, but with an undercurrent of inhuman\nexaltation\n\nWho would condescend to strike down the mere things that he does not fear?\nWho would debase himself to be merely brave, like any common prizefighter? Who\nwould stoop to be fearlesslike a tree? Fight the thing that you fear. You\nremember the old tale of the English clergyman who gave the last rites to the\nbrigand of Sicily, and how on his death-bed the great robber said, I can give\nyou no money, but I can give you advice for a lifetime: your thumb on the\nblade, and strike upwards. So I say to you, strike upwards, if you strike at\nthe stars.\n\nThe other looked at the ceiling, one of the tricks of his pose.\n\nSunday is a fixed star, he said.\n\nYou shall see him a falling star, said Syme, and put on his hat.\n\nThe decision of his gesture drew the Professor vaguely to his feet.\n\nHave you any idea, he asked, with a sort of benevolent bewilderment,\nexactly where you are going?\n\nYes, replied Syme shortly, I am going to prevent this bomb being thrown in\nParis.\n\nHave you any conception how? inquired the other.\n\nNo, said Syme with equal decision.\n\nYou remember, of course, resumed the soi-disant de Worms, pulling his beard\nand looking out of the window, that when we broke up rather hurriedly the\nwhole arrangements for the atrocity were left in the private hands of the\nMarquis and Dr. Bull. The Marquis is by this time probably crossing the\nChannel. But where he will go and what he will do it is doubtful whether even\nthe President knows; certainly we dont know. The only man who does know is\nDr. Bull.\n\nConfound it! cried Syme. And we dont know where he is.\n\nYes, said the other in his curious, absent-minded way, I know where he is\nmyself.\n\nWill you tell me? asked Syme with eager eyes.\n\nI will take you there, said the Professor, and took down his own hat from a\npeg.\n\nSyme stood looking at him with a sort of rigid excitement.\n\nWhat do you mean? he asked sharply. Will you join me? Will you take the\nrisk?\n\nYoung man, said the Professor pleasantly, I am amused to observe that you\nthink I am a coward. As to that I will say only one word, and that shall be\nentirely in the manner of your own philosophical rhetoric. You think that it\nis possible to pull down the President. I know that it is impossible, and I am\ngoing to try it, and opening the tavern door, which let in a blast of bitter\nair, they went out together into the dark streets by the docks.\n\nMost of the snow was melted or trampled to mud, but here and there a clot of\nit still showed grey rather than white in the gloom. The small streets were\nsloppy and full of pools, which reflected the flaming lamps irregularly, and\nby accident, like fragments of some other and fallen world. Syme felt almost\ndazed as he stepped through this growing confusion of lights and shadows; but\nhis companion walked on with a certain briskness, towards where, at the end of\nthe street, an inch or two of the lamplit river looked like a bar of flame.\n\nWhere are you going? Syme inquired.\n\nJust now, answered the Professor, I am going just round the corner to see\nwhether Dr. Bull has gone to bed. He is hygienic, and retires early.\n\nDr. Bull! exclaimed Syme. Does he live round the corner?\n\nNo, answered his friend. As a matter of fact he lives some way off, on the\nother side of the river, but we can tell from here whether he has gone to\nbed.\n\nTurning the corner as he spoke, and facing the dim river, flecked with flame,\nhe pointed with his stick to the other bank. On the Surrey side at this point\nthere ran out into the Thames, seeming almost to overhang it, a bulk and\ncluster of those tall tenements, dotted with lighted windows, and rising like\nfactory chimneys to an almost insane height. Their special poise and position\nmade one block of buildings especially look like a Tower of Babel with a\nhundred eyes. Syme had never seen any of the sky-scraping buildings in\nAmerica, so he could only think of the buildings in a dream.\n\nEven as he stared, the highest light in this innumerably lighted turret\nabruptly went out, as if this black Argus had winked at him with one of his\ninnumerable eyes.\n\nProfessor de Worms swung round on his heel, and struck his stick against his\nboot.\n\nWe are too late, he said, the hygienic Doctor has gone to bed.\n\nWhat do you mean? asked Syme. Does he live over there, then?\n\nYes, said de Worms, behind that particular window which you cant see. Come\nalong and get some dinner. We must call on him tomorrow morning.\n\nWithout further parley, he led the way through several by-ways until they came\nout into the flare and clamour of the East India Dock Road. The Professor, who\nseemed to know his way about the neighbourhood, proceeded to a place where the\nline of lighted shops fell back into a sort of abrupt twilight and quiet, in\nwhich an old white inn, all out of repair, stood back some twenty feet from\nthe road.\n\nYou can find good English inns left by accident everywhere, like fossils,\nexplained the Professor. I once found a decent place in the West End.\n\nI suppose, said Syme, smiling, that this is the corresponding decent place\nin the East End?\n\nIt is, said the Professor reverently, and went in.\n\nIn that place they dined and slept, both very thoroughly. The beans and bacon,\nwhich these unaccountable people cooked well, the astonishing emergence of\nBurgundy from their cellars, crowned Symes sense of a new comradeship and\ncomfort. Through all this ordeal his root horror had been isolation, and there\nare no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally. It\nmay be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two. But two is not\ntwice one; two is two thousand times one. That is why, in spite of a hundred\ndisadvantages, the world will always return to monogamy.\n\nSyme was able to pour out for the first time the whole of his outrageous tale,\nfrom the time when Gregory had taken him to the little tavern by the river. He\ndid it idly and amply, in a luxuriant monologue, as a man speaks with very old\nfriends. On his side, also, the man who had impersonated Professor de Worms\nwas not less communicative. His own story was almost as silly as Symes.\n\nThats a good get-up of yours, said Syme, draining a glass of Macon; a lot\nbetter than old Gogols. Even at the start I thought he was a bit too hairy.\n\nA difference of artistic theory, replied the Professor pensively. Gogol was\nan idealist. He made up as the abstract or platonic ideal of an anarchist. But\nI am a realist. I am a portrait painter. But, indeed, to say that I am a\nportrait painter is an inadequate expression. I am a portrait.\n\nI dont understand you, said Syme.\n\nI am a portrait, repeated the Professor. I am a portrait of the celebrated\nProfessor de Worms, who is, I believe, in Naples.\n\nYou mean you are made up like him, said Syme. But doesnt he know that you\nare taking his nose in vain?\n\nHe knows it right enough, replied his friend cheerfully.\n\nThen why doesnt he denounce you?\n\nI have denounced him, answered the Professor.\n\nDo explain yourself, said Syme.\n\nWith pleasure, if you dont mind hearing my story, replied the eminent\nforeign philosopher. I am by profession an actor, and my name is Wilks. When\nI was on the stage I mixed with all sorts of Bohemian and blackguard company.\nSometimes I touched the edge of the turf, sometimes the riff-raff of the arts,\nand occasionally the political refugee. In some den of exiled dreamers I was\nintroduced to the great German Nihilist philosopher, Professor de Worms. I did\nnot gather much about him beyond his appearance, which was very disgusting,\nand which I studied carefully. I understood that he had proved that the\ndestructive principle in the universe was God; hence he insisted on the need\nfor a furious and incessant energy, rending all things in pieces. Energy, he\nsaid, was the All. He was lame, shortsighted, and partially paralytic. When I\nmet him I was in a frivolous mood, and I disliked him so much that I resolved\nto imitate him. If I had been a draughtsman I would have drawn a caricature. I\nwas only an actor, I could only act a caricature. I made myself up into what\nwas meant for a wild exaggeration of the old Professors dirty old self. When\nI went into the room full of his supporters I expected to be received with a\nroar of laughter, or (if they were too far gone) with a roar of indignation at\nthe insult. I cannot describe the surprise I felt when my entrance was\nreceived with a respectful silence, followed (when I had first opened my lips)\nwith a murmur of admiration. The curse of the perfect artist had fallen upon\nme. I had been too subtle, I had been too true. They thought I really was the\ngreat Nihilist Professor. I was a healthy-minded young man at the time, and I\nconfess that it was a blow. Before I could fully recover, however, two or\nthree of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation, and told me that a\npublic insult had been put upon me in the next room. I inquired its nature. It\nseemed that an impertinent fellow had dressed himself up as a preposterous\nparody of myself. I had drunk more champagne than was good for me, and in a\nflash of folly I decided to see the situation through. Consequently it was to\nmeet the glare of the company and my own lifted eyebrows and freezing eyes\nthat the real Professor came into the room.\n\nI need hardly say there was a collision. The pessimists all round me looked\nanxiously from one Professor to the other Professor to see which was really\nthe more feeble. But I won. An old man in poor health, like my rival, could\nnot be expected to be so impressively feeble as a young actor in the prime of\nlife. You see, he really had paralysis, and working within this definite\nlimitation, he couldnt be so jolly paralytic as I was. Then he tried to blast\nmy claims intellectually. I countered that by a very simple dodge. Whenever he\nsaid something that nobody but he could understand, I replied with something\nwhich I could not even understand myself. I dont fancy, he said, that you\ncould have worked out the principle that evolution is only negation, since\nthere inheres in it the introduction of lacuna, which are an essential of\ndifferentiation. I replied quite scornfully, You read all that up in\nPinckwerts; the notion that involution functioned eugenically was exposed long\nago by Glumpe. It is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such\npeople as Pinckwerts and Glumpe. But the people all round (rather to my\nsurprise) seemed to remember them quite well, and the Professor, finding that\nthe learned and mysterious method left him rather at the mercy of an enemy\nslightly deficient in scruples, fell back upon a more popular form of wit. I\nsee, he sneered, you prevail like the false pig in Aesop. And you fail, I\nanswered, smiling, like the hedgehog in Montaigne. Need I say that there is\nno hedgehog in Montaigne? Your claptrap comes off, he said; so would your\nbeard. I had no intelligent answer to this, which was quite true and rather\nwitty. But I laughed heartily, answered, Like the Pantheists boots, at\nrandom, and turned on my heel with all the honours of victory. The real\nProfessor was thrown out, but not with violence, though one man tried very\npatiently to pull off his nose. He is now, I believe, received everywhere in\nEurope as a delightful impostor. His apparent earnestness and anger, you see,\nmake him all the more entertaining.\n\nWell, said Syme, I can understand your putting on his dirty old beard for a\nnights practical joke, but I dont understand your never taking it off\nagain.\n\nThat is the rest of the story, said the impersonator. When I myself left\nthe company, followed by reverent applause, I went limping down the dark\nstreet, hoping that I should soon be far enough away to be able to walk like a\nhuman being. To my astonishment, as I was turning the corner, I felt a touch\non the shoulder, and turning, found myself under the shadow of an enormous\npoliceman. He told me I was wanted. I struck a sort of paralytic attitude, and\ncried in a high German accent, Yes, I am wantedby the oppressed of the\nworld. You are arresting me on the charge of being the great anarchist,\nProfessor de Worms. The policeman impassively consulted a paper in his hand,\nNo, sir, he said civilly, at least, not exactly, sir. I am arresting you on\nthe charge of not being the celebrated anarchist, Professor de Worms. This\ncharge, if it was criminal at all, was certainly the lighter of the two, and I\nwent along with the man, doubtful, but not greatly dismayed. I was shown into\na number of rooms, and eventually into the presence of a police officer, who\nexplained that a serious campaign had been opened against the centres of\nanarchy, and that this, my successful masquerade, might be of considerable\nvalue to the public safety. He offered me a good salary and this little blue\ncard. Though our conversation was short, he struck me as a man of very massive\ncommon sense and humour; but I cannot tell you much about him personally,\nbecause\n\nSyme laid down his knife and fork.\n\nI know, he said, because you talked to him in a dark room.\n\nProfessor de Worms nodded and drained his glass.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER IX. THE MAN IN SPECTACLES\n\nBURGUNDY is a jolly thing, said the Professor sadly, as he set his glass\ndown.\n\nYou dont look as if it were, said Syme; you drink it as if it were\nmedicine.\n\nYou must excuse my manner, said the Professor dismally, my position is\nrather a curious one. Inside I am really bursting with boyish merriment; but I\nacted the paralytic Professor so well, that now I cant leave off. So that\nwhen I am among friends, and have no need at all to disguise myself, I still\ncant help speaking slow and wrinkling my foreheadjust as if it were my\nforehead. I can be quite happy, you understand, but only in a paralytic sort\nof way. The most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart, but they come out\nof my mouth quite different. You should hear me say, Buck up, old cock! It\nwould bring tears to your eyes.\n\nIt does, said Syme; but I cannot help thinking that apart from all that you\nare really a bit worried.\n\nThe Professor started a little and looked at him steadily.\n\nYou are a very clever fellow, he said, it is a pleasure to work with you.\nYes, I have rather a heavy cloud in my head. There is a great problem to\nface, and he sank his bald brow in his two hands.\n\nThen he said in a low voice\n\nCan you play the piano?\n\nYes, said Syme in simple wonder, Im supposed to have a good touch.\n\nThen, as the other did not speak, he added\n\nI trust the great cloud is lifted.\n\nAfter a long silence, the Professor said out of the cavernous shadow of his\nhands\n\nIt would have done just as well if you could work a typewriter.\n\nThank you, said Syme, you flatter me.\n\nListen to me, said the other, and remember whom we have to see tomorrow.\nYou and I are going tomorrow to attempt something which is very much more\ndangerous than trying to steal the Crown Jewels out of the Tower. We are\ntrying to steal a secret from a very sharp, very strong, and very wicked man.\nI believe there is no man, except the President, of course, who is so\nseriously startling and formidable as that little grinning fellow in goggles.\nHe has not perhaps the white-hot enthusiasm unto death, the mad martyrdom for\nanarchy, which marks the Secretary. But then that very fanaticism in the\nSecretary has a human pathos, and is almost a redeeming trait. But the little\nDoctor has a brutal sanity that is more shocking than the Secretarys disease.\nDont you notice his detestable virility and vitality. He bounces like an\nindia-rubber ball. Depend on it, Sunday was not asleep (I wonder if he ever\nsleeps?) when he locked up all the plans of this outrage in the round, black\nhead of Dr. Bull.\n\nAnd you think, said Syme, that this unique monster will be soothed if I\nplay the piano to him?\n\nDont be an ass, said his mentor. I mentioned the piano because it gives\none quick and independent fingers. Syme, if we are to go through this\ninterview and come out sane or alive, we must have some code of signals\nbetween us that this brute will not see. I have made a rough alphabetical\ncypher corresponding to the five fingerslike this, see, and he rippled with\nhis fingers on the wooden tableB A D, bad, a word we may frequently\nrequire.\n\nSyme poured himself out another glass of wine, and began to study the scheme.\nHe was abnormally quick with his brains at puzzles, and with his hands at\nconjuring, and it did not take him long to learn how he might convey simple\nmessages by what would seem to be idle taps upon a table or knee. But wine and\ncompanionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity,\nand the Professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of\nthe new language, as it passed through the heated brain of Syme.\n\nWe must have several word-signs, said Syme seriouslywords that we are\nlikely to want, fine shades of meaning. My favourite word is coeval. Whats\nyours?\n\nDo stop playing the goat, said the Professor plaintively. You dont know\nhow serious this is.\n\nLush too, said Syme, shaking his head sagaciously, we must have\nlushword applied to grass, dont you know?\n\nDo you imagine, asked the Professor furiously, that we are going to talk to\nDr. Bull about grass?\n\nThere are several ways in which the subject could be approached, said Syme\nreflectively, and the word introduced without appearing forced. We might say,\nDr. Bull, as a revolutionist, you remember that a tyrant once advised us to\neat grass; and indeed many of us, looking on the fresh lush grass of\nsummer...\n\nDo you understand, said the other, that this is a tragedy?\n\nPerfectly, replied Syme; always be comic in a tragedy. What the deuce else\ncan you do? I wish this language of yours had a wider scope. I suppose we\ncould not extend it from the fingers to the toes? That would involve pulling\noff our boots and socks during the conversation, which however unobtrusively\nperformed\n\nSyme, said his friend with a stern simplicity, go to bed!\n\nSyme, however, sat up in bed for a considerable time mastering the new code.\nHe was awakened next morning while the east was still sealed with darkness,\nand found his grey-bearded ally standing like a ghost beside his bed.\n\nSyme sat up in bed blinking; then slowly collected his thoughts, threw off the\nbed-clothes, and stood up. It seemed to him in some curious way that all the\nsafety and sociability of the night before fell with the bedclothes off him,\nand he stood up in an air of cold danger. He still felt an entire trust and\nloyalty towards his companion; but it was the trust between two men going to\nthe scaffold.\n\nWell, said Syme with a forced cheerfulness as he pulled on his trousers, I\ndreamt of that alphabet of yours. Did it take you long to make it up?\n\nThe Professor made no answer, but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour\nof a wintry sea; so Syme repeated his question.\n\nI say, did it take you long to invent all this? Im considered good at these\nthings, and it was a good hours grind. Did you learn it all on the spot?\n\nThe Professor was silent; his eyes were wide open, and he wore a fixed but\nvery small smile.\n\nHow long did it take you?\n\nThe Professor did not move.\n\nConfound you, cant you answer? called out Syme, in a sudden anger that had\nsomething like fear underneath. Whether or no the Professor could answer, he\ndid not.\n\nSyme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank, blue\neyes. His first thought was that the Professor had gone mad, but his second\nthought was more frightful. After all, what did he know about this queer\ncreature whom he had heedlessly accepted as a friend? What did he know, except\nthat the man had been at the anarchist breakfast and had told him a ridiculous\ntale? How improbable it was that there should be another friend there beside\nGogol! Was this mans silence a sensational way of declaring war? Was this\nadamantine stare after all only the awful sneer of some threefold traitor, who\nhad turned for the last time? He stood and strained his ears in this heartless\nsilence. He almost fancied he could hear dynamiters come to capture him\nshifting softly in the corridor outside.\n\nThen his eye strayed downwards, and he burst out laughing. Though the\nProfessor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue, his five dumb fingers\nwere dancing alive upon the dead table. Syme watched the twinkling movements\nof the talking hand, and read clearly the message\n\nI will only talk like this. We must get used to it.\n\nHe rapped out the answer with the impatience of relief\n\nAll right. Lets get out to breakfast.\n\nThey took their hats and sticks in silence; but as Syme took his sword-stick,\nhe held it hard.\n\nThey paused for a few minutes only to stuff down coffee and coarse thick\nsandwiches at a coffee stall, and then made their way across the river, which\nunder the grey and growing light looked as desolate as Acheron. They reached\nthe bottom of the huge block of buildings which they had seen from across the\nriver, and began in silence to mount the naked and numberless stone steps,\nonly pausing now and then to make short remarks on the rail of the banisters.\nAt about every other flight they passed a window; each window showed them a\npale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over London. From each the\ninnumerable roofs of slate looked like the leaden surges of a grey, troubled\nsea after rain. Syme was increasingly conscious that his new adventure had\nsomehow a quality of cold sanity worse than the wild adventures of the past.\nLast night, for instance, the tall tenements had seemed to him like a tower in\na dream. As he now went up the weary and perpetual steps, he was daunted and\nbewildered by their almost infinite series. But it was not the hot horror of a\ndream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion. Their infinity\nwas more like the empty infinity of arithmetic, something unthinkable, yet\nnecessary to thought. Or it was like the stunning statements of astronomy\nabout the distance of the fixed stars. He was ascending the house of reason, a\nthing more hideous than unreason itself.\n\nBy the time they reached Dr. Bulls landing, a last window showed them a\nharsh, white dawn edged with banks of a kind of coarse red, more like red clay\nthan red cloud. And when they entered Dr. Bulls bare garret it was full of\nlight.\n\nSyme had been haunted by a half historic memory in connection with these empty\nrooms and that austere daybreak. The moment he saw the garret and Dr. Bull\nsitting writing at a table, he remembered what the memory wasthe French\nRevolution. There should have been the black outline of a guillotine against\nthat heavy red and white of the morning. Dr. Bull was in his white shirt and\nblack breeches only; his cropped, dark head might well have just come out of\nits wig; he might have been Marat or a more slipshod Robespierre.\n\nYet when he was seen properly, the French fancy fell away. The Jacobins were\nidealists; there was about this man a murderous materialism. His position gave\nhim a somewhat new appearance. The strong, white light of morning coming from\none side creating sharp shadows, made him seem both more pale and more angular\nthan he had looked at the breakfast on the balcony. Thus the two black glasses\nthat encased his eyes might really have been black cavities in his skull,\nmaking him look like a deaths-head. And, indeed, if ever Death himself sat\nwriting at a wooden table, it might have been he.\n\nHe looked up and smiled brightly enough as the men came in, and rose with the\nresilient rapidity of which the Professor had spoken. He set chairs for both\nof them, and going to a peg behind the door, proceeded to put on a coat and\nwaistcoat of rough, dark tweed; he buttoned it up neatly, and came back to sit\ndown at his table.\n\nThe quiet good humour of his manner left his two opponents helpless. It was\nwith some momentary difficulty that the Professor broke silence and began,\nIm sorry to disturb you so early, comrade, said he, with a careful\nresumption of the slow de Worms manner. You have no doubt made all the\narrangements for the Paris affair? Then he added with infinite slowness, We\nhave information which renders intolerable anything in the nature of a\nmoments delay.\n\nDr. Bull smiled again, but continued to gaze on them without speaking. The\nProfessor resumed, a pause before each weary word\n\nPlease do not think me excessively abrupt; but I advise you to alter those\nplans, or if it is too late for that, to follow your agent with all the\nsupport you can get for him. Comrade Syme and I have had an experience which\nit would take more time to recount than we can afford, if we are to act on it.\nI will, however, relate the occurrence in detail, even at the risk of losing\ntime, if you really feel that it is essential to the understanding of the\nproblem we have to discuss.\n\nHe was spinning out his sentences, making them intolerably long and lingering,\nin the hope of maddening the practical little Doctor into an explosion of\nimpatience which might show his hand. But the little Doctor continued only to\nstare and smile, and the monologue was uphill work. Syme began to feel a new\nsickness and despair. The Doctors smile and silence were not at all like the\ncataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the Professor\nhalf an hour before. About the Professors makeup and all his antics there was\nalways something merely grotesque, like a gollywog. Syme remembered those wild\nwoes of yesterday as one remembers being afraid of Bogy in childhood. But here\nwas daylight; here was a healthy, square-shouldered man in tweeds, not odd\nsave for the accident of his ugly spectacles, not glaring or grinning at all,\nbut smiling steadily and not saying a word. The whole had a sense of\nunbearable reality. Under the increasing sunlight the colours of the Doctors\ncomplexion, the pattern of his tweeds, grew and expanded outrageously, as such\nthings grow too important in a realistic novel. But his smile was quite\nslight, the pose of his head polite; the only uncanny thing was his silence.\n\nAs I say, resumed the Professor, like a man toiling through heavy sand, the\nincident that has occurred to us and has led us to ask for information about\nthe Marquis, is one which you may think it better to have narrated; but as it\ncame in the way of Comrade Syme rather than me\n\nHis words he seemed to be dragging out like words in an anthem; but Syme, who\nwas watching, saw his long fingers rattle quickly on the edge of the crazy\ntable. He read the message, You must go on. This devil has sucked me dry!\n\nSyme plunged into the breach with that bravado of improvisation which always\ncame to him when he was alarmed.\n\nYes, the thing really happened to me, he said hastily. I had the good\nfortune to fall into conversation with a detective who took me, thanks to my\nhat, for a respectable person. Wishing to clinch my reputation for\nrespectability, I took him and made him very drunk at the Savoy. Under this\ninfluence he became friendly, and told me in so many words that within a day\nor two they hope to arrest the Marquis in France.\n\nSo unless you or I can get on his track\n\nThe Doctor was still smiling in the most friendly way, and his protected eyes\nwere still impenetrable. The Professor signalled to Syme that he would resume\nhis explanation, and he began again with the same elaborate calm.\n\nSyme immediately brought this information to me, and we came here together to\nsee what use you would be inclined to make of it. It seems to me\nunquestionably urgent that\n\nAll this time Syme had been staring at the Doctor almost as steadily as the\nDoctor stared at the Professor, but quite without the smile. The nerves of\nboth comrades-in-arms were near snapping under that strain of motionless\namiability, when Syme suddenly leant forward and idly tapped the edge of the\ntable. His message to his ally ran, I have an intuition.\n\nThe Professor, with scarcely a pause in his monologue, signalled back, Then\nsit on it.\n\nSyme telegraphed, It is quite extraordinary.\n\nThe other answered, Extraordinary rot!\n\nSyme said, I am a poet.\n\nThe other retorted, You are a dead man.\n\nSyme had gone quite red up to his yellow hair, and his eyes were burning\nfeverishly. As he said he had an intuition, and it had risen to a sort of\nlightheaded certainty. Resuming his symbolic taps, he signalled to his friend,\nYou scarcely realise how poetic my intuition is. It has that sudden quality\nwe sometimes feel in the coming of spring.\n\nHe then studied the answer on his friends fingers. The answer was, Go to\nhell!\n\nThe Professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the\nDoctor.\n\nPerhaps I should rather say, said Syme on his fingers, that it resembles\nthat sudden smell of the sea which may be found in the heart of lush woods.\n\nHis companion disdained to reply.\n\nOr yet again, tapped Syme, it is positive, as is the passionate red hair of\na beautiful woman.\n\nThe Professor was continuing his speech, but in the middle of it Syme decided\nto act. He leant across the table, and said in a voice that could not be\nneglected\n\nDr. Bull!\n\nThe Doctors sleek and smiling head did not move, but they could have sworn\nthat under his dark glasses his eyes darted towards Syme.\n\nDr. Bull, said Syme, in a voice peculiarly precise and courteous, would you\ndo me a small favour? Would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles?\n\nThe Professor swung round on his seat, and stared at Syme with a sort of\nfrozen fury of astonishment. Syme, like a man who has thrown his life and\nfortune on the table, leaned forward with a fiery face. The Doctor did not\nmove.\n\nFor a few seconds there was a silence in which one could hear a pin drop,\nsplit once by the single hoot of a distant steamer on the Thames. Then Dr.\nBull rose slowly, still smiling, and took off his spectacles.\n\nSyme sprang to his feet, stepping backwards a little, like a chemical lecturer\nfrom a successful explosion. His eyes were like stars, and for an instant he\ncould only point without speaking.\n\nThe Professor had also started to his feet, forgetful of his supposed\nparalysis. He leant on the back of the chair and stared doubtfully at Dr.\nBull, as if the Doctor had been turned into a toad before his eyes. And indeed\nit was almost as great a transformation scene.\n\nThe two detectives saw sitting in the chair before them a very boyish-looking\nyoung man, with very frank and happy hazel eyes, an open expression, cockney\nclothes like those of a city clerk, and an unquestionable breath about him of\nbeing very good and rather commonplace. The smile was still there, but it\nmight have been the first smile of a baby.\n\nI knew I was a poet, cried Syme in a sort of ecstasy. I knew my intuition\nwas as infallible as the Pope. It was the spectacles that did it! It was all\nthe spectacles. Given those beastly black eyes, and all the rest of him his\nhealth and his jolly looks, made him a live devil among dead ones.\n\nIt certainly does make a queer difference, said the Professor shakily. But\nas regards the project of Dr. Bull\n\nProject be damned! roared Syme, beside himself. Look at him! Look at his\nface, look at his collar, look at his blessed boots! You dont suppose, do\nyou, that that things an anarchist?\n\nSyme! cried the other in an apprehensive agony.\n\nWhy, by God, said Syme, Ill take the risk of that myself! Dr. Bull, I am a\npolice officer. Theres my card, and he flung down the blue card upon the\ntable.\n\nThe Professor still feared that all was lost; but he was loyal. He pulled out\nhis own official card and put it beside his friends. Then the third man burst\nout laughing, and for the first time that morning they heard his voice.\n\nIm awfully glad you chaps have come so early, he said, with a sort of\nschoolboy flippancy, for we can all start for France together. Yes, Im in\nthe force right enough, and he flicked a blue card towards them lightly as a\nmatter of form.\n\nClapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses, the\nDoctor moved so quickly towards the door, that the others instinctively\nfollowed him. Syme seemed a little distrait, and as he passed under the\ndoorway he suddenly struck his stick on the stone passage so that it rang.\n\nBut Lord God Almighty, he cried out, if this is all right, there were more\ndamned detectives than there were damned dynamiters at the damned Council!\n\nWe might have fought easily, said Bull; we were four against three.\n\nThe Professor was descending the stairs, but his voice came up from below.\n\nNo, said the voice, we were not four against threewe were not so lucky. We\nwere four against One.\n\nThe others went down the stairs in silence.\n\nThe young man called Bull, with an innocent courtesy characteristic of him,\ninsisted on going last until they reached the street; but there his own robust\nrapidity asserted itself unconsciously, and he walked quickly on ahead towards\na railway inquiry office, talking to the others over his shoulder.\n\nIt is jolly to get some pals, he said. Ive been half dead with the jumps,\nbeing quite alone. I nearly flung my arms round Gogol and embraced him, which\nwould have been imprudent. I hope you wont despise me for having been in a\nblue funk.\n\nAll the blue devils in blue hell, said Syme, contributed to my blue funk!\nBut the worst devil was you and your infernal goggles.\n\nThe young man laughed delightedly.\n\nWasnt it a rag? he said. Such a simple ideanot my own. I havent got the\nbrains. You see, I wanted to go into the detective service, especially the\nanti-dynamite business. But for that purpose they wanted someone to dress up\nas a dynamiter; and they all swore by blazes that I could never look like a\ndynamiter. They said my very walk was respectable, and that seen from behind I\nlooked like the British Constitution. They said I looked too healthy and too\noptimistic, and too reliable and benevolent; they called me all sorts of names\nat Scotland Yard. They said that if I had been a criminal, I might have made\nmy fortune by looking so like an honest man; but as I had the misfortune to be\nan honest man, there was not even the remotest chance of my assisting them by\never looking like a criminal. But at last I was brought before some old josser\nwho was high up in the force, and who seemed to have no end of a head on his\nshoulders. And there the others all talked hopelessly. One asked whether a\nbushy beard would hide my nice smile; another said that if they blacked my\nface I might look like a negro anarchist; but this old chap chipped in with a\nmost extraordinary remark. A pair of smoked spectacles will do it, he said\npositively. Look at him now; he looks like an angelic office boy. Put him on\na pair of smoked spectacles, and children will scream at the sight of him.\nAnd so it was, by George! When once my eyes were covered, all the rest, smile\nand big shoulders and short hair, made me look a perfect little devil. As I\nsay, it was simple enough when it was done, like miracles; but that wasnt the\nreally miraculous part of it. There was one really staggering thing about the\nbusiness, and my head still turns at it.\n\nWhat was that? asked Syme.\n\nIll tell you, answered the man in spectacles. This big pot in the police\nwho sized me up so that he knew how the goggles would go with my hair and\nsocksby God, he never saw me at all!\n\nSymes eyes suddenly flashed on him.\n\nHow was that? he asked. I thought you talked to him.\n\nSo I did, said Bull brightly; but we talked in a pitch-dark room like a\ncoalcellar. There, you would never have guessed that.\n\nI could not have conceived it, said Syme gravely.\n\nIt is indeed a new idea, said the Professor.\n\nTheir new ally was in practical matters a whirlwind. At the inquiry office he\nasked with businesslike brevity about the trains for Dover. Having got his\ninformation, he bundled the company into a cab, and put them and himself\ninside a railway carriage before they had properly realised the breathless\nprocess. They were already on the Calais boat before conversation flowed\nfreely.\n\nI had already arranged, he explained, to go to France for my lunch; but I\nam delighted to have someone to lunch with me. You see, I had to send that\nbeast, the Marquis, over with his bomb, because the President had his eye on\nme, though God knows how. Ill tell you the story some day. It was perfectly\nchoking. Whenever I tried to slip out of it I saw the President somewhere,\nsmiling out of the bow-window of a club, or taking off his hat to me from the\ntop of an omnibus. I tell you, you can say what you like, that fellow sold\nhimself to the devil; he can be in six places at once.\n\nSo you sent the Marquis off, I understand, asked the Professor. Was it long\nago? Shall we be in time to catch him?\n\nYes, answered the new guide, Ive timed it all. Hell still be at Calais\nwhen we arrive.\n\nBut when we do catch him at Calais, said the Professor, what are we going\nto do?\n\nAt this question the countenance of Dr. Bull fell for the first time. He\nreflected a little, and then said\n\nTheoretically, I suppose, we ought to call the police.\n\nNot I, said Syme. Theoretically I ought to drown myself first. I promised a\npoor fellow, who was a real modern pessimist, on my word of honour not to tell\nthe police. Im no hand at casuistry, but I cant break my word to a modern\npessimist. Its like breaking ones word to a child.\n\nIm in the same boat, said the Professor. I tried to tell the police and I\ncouldnt, because of some silly oath I took. You see, when I was an actor I\nwas a sort of all-round beast. Perjury or treason is the only crime I havent\ncommitted. If I did that I shouldnt know the difference between right and\nwrong.\n\nIve been through all that, said Dr. Bull, and Ive made up my mind. I gave\nmy promise to the Secretaryyou know him, man who smiles upside down. My\nfriends, that man is the most utterly unhappy man that was ever human. It may\nbe his digestion, or his conscience, or his nerves, or his philosophy of the\nuniverse, but hes damned, hes in hell! Well, I cant turn on a man like\nthat, and hunt him down. Its like whipping a leper. I may be mad, but thats\nhow I feel; and theres jolly well the end of it.\n\nI dont think youre mad, said Syme. I knew you would decide like that when\nfirst you\n\nEh? said Dr. Bull.\n\nWhen first you took off your spectacles.\n\nDr. Bull smiled a little, and strolled across the deck to look at the sunlit\nsea. Then he strolled back again, kicking his heels carelessly, and a\ncompanionable silence fell between the three men.\n\nWell, said Syme, it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or\nimmorality, so we had better face the fact that comes of it.\n\nYes, assented the Professor, youre quite right; and we must hurry up, for\nI can see the Grey Nose standing out from France.\n\nThe fact that comes of it, said Syme seriously, is this, that we three are\nalone on this planet. Gogol has gone, God knows where; perhaps the President\nhas smashed him like a fly. On the Council we are three men against three,\nlike the Romans who held the bridge. But we are worse off than that, first\nbecause they can appeal to their organization and we cannot appeal to ours,\nand second because\n\nBecause one of those other three men, said the Professor, is not a man.\n\nSyme nodded and was silent for a second or two, then he said\n\nMy idea is this. We must do something to keep the Marquis in Calais till\ntomorrow midday. I have turned over twenty schemes in my head. We cannot\ndenounce him as a dynamiter; that is agreed. We cannot get him detained on\nsome trivial charge, for we should have to appear; he knows us, and he would\nsmell a rat. We cannot pretend to keep him on anarchist business; he might\nswallow much in that way, but not the notion of stopping in Calais while the\nCzar went safely through Paris. We might try to kidnap him, and lock him up\nourselves; but he is a well-known man here. He has a whole bodyguard of\nfriends; he is very strong and brave, and the event is doubtful. The only\nthing I can see to do is actually to take advantage of the very things that\nare in the Marquiss favour. I am going to profit by the fact that he is a\nhighly respected nobleman. I am going to profit by the fact that he has many\nfriends and moves in the best society.\n\nWhat the devil are you talking about? asked the Professor.\n\nThe Symes are first mentioned in the fourteenth century, said Syme; but\nthere is a tradition that one of them rode behind Bruce at Bannockburn. Since\n1350 the tree is quite clear.\n\nHes gone off his head, said the little Doctor, staring.\n\nOur bearings, continued Syme calmly, are argent a chevron gules charged\nwith three cross crosslets of the field. The motto varies.\n\nThe Professor seized Syme roughly by the waistcoat.\n\nWe are just inshore, he said. Are you seasick or joking in the wrong\nplace?\n\nMy remarks are almost painfully practical, answered Syme, in an unhurried\nmanner. The house of St. Eustache also is very ancient. The Marquis cannot\ndeny that he is a gentleman. He cannot deny that I am a gentleman. And in\norder to put the matter of my social position quite beyond a doubt, I propose\nat the earliest opportunity to knock his hat off. But here we are in the\nharbour.\n\nThey went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze. Syme, who had now\ntaken the lead as Bull had taken it in London, led them along a kind of marine\nparade until he came to some cafes, embowered in a bulk of greenery and\noverlooking the sea. As he went before them his step was slightly swaggering,\nand he swung his stick like a sword. He was making apparently for the extreme\nend of the line of cafes, but he stopped abruptly. With a sharp gesture he\nmotioned them to silence, but he pointed with one gloved finger to a cafe\ntable under a bank of flowering foliage at which sat the Marquis de St.\nEustache, his teeth shining in his thick, black beard, and his bold, brown\nface shadowed by a light yellow straw hat and outlined against the violet sea.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER X. THE DUEL\n\nSYME sat down at a cafe table with his companions, his blue eyes sparkling\nlike the bright sea below, and ordered a bottle of Saumur with a pleased\nimpatience. He was for some reason in a condition of curious hilarity. His\nspirits were already unnaturally high; they rose as the Saumur sank, and in\nhalf an hour his talk was a torrent of nonsense. He professed to be making out\na plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the\ndeadly Marquis. He jotted it down wildly with a pencil. It was arranged like a\nprinted catechism, with questions and answers, and was delivered with an\nextraordinary rapidity of utterance.\n\nI shall approach. Before taking off his hat, I shall take off my own. I shall\nsay, The Marquis de Saint Eustache, I believe. He will say, The celebrated\nMr. Syme, I presume. He will say in the most exquisite French, How are you?\nI shall reply in the most exquisite Cockney, Oh, just the Syme\n\nOh, shut it, said the man in spectacles. Pull yourself together, and chuck\naway that bit of paper. What are you really going to do?\n\nBut it was a lovely catechism, said Syme pathetically. Do let me read it\nyou. It has only forty-three questions and answers, and some of the Marquiss\nanswers are wonderfully witty. I like to be just to my enemy.\n\nBut whats the good of it all? asked Dr. Bull in exasperation.\n\nIt leads up to my challenge, dont you see, said Syme, beaming. When the\nMarquis has given the thirty-ninth reply, which runs\n\nHas it by any chance occurred to you, asked the Professor, with a ponderous\nsimplicity, that the Marquis may not say all the forty-three things you have\nput down for him? In that case, I understand, your own epigrams may appear\nsomewhat more forced.\n\nSyme struck the table with a radiant face.\n\nWhy, how true that is, he said, and I never thought of it. Sir, you have an\nintellect beyond the common. You will make a name.\n\nOh, youre as drunk as an owl! said the Doctor.\n\nIt only remains, continued Syme quite unperturbed, to adopt some other\nmethod of breaking the ice (if I may so express it) between myself and the man\nI wish to kill. And since the course of a dialogue cannot be predicted by one\nof its parties alone (as you have pointed out with such recondite acumen), the\nonly thing to be done, I suppose, is for the one party, as far as possible, to\ndo all the dialogue by himself. And so I will, by George! And he stood up\nsuddenly, his yellow hair blowing in the slight sea breeze.\n\nA band was playing in a cafe chantant hidden somewhere among the trees, and a\nwoman had just stopped singing. On Symes heated head the bray of the brass\nband seemed like the jar and jingle of that barrel-organ in Leicester Square,\nto the tune of which he had once stood up to die. He looked across to the\nlittle table where the Marquis sat. The man had two companions now, solemn\nFrenchmen in frock-coats and silk hats, one of them with the red rosette of\nthe Legion of Honour, evidently people of a solid social position. Besides\nthese black, cylindrical costumes, the Marquis, in his loose straw hat and\nlight spring clothes, looked Bohemian and even barbaric; but he looked the\nMarquis. Indeed, one might say that he looked the king, with his animal\nelegance, his scornful eyes, and his proud head lifted against the purple sea.\nBut he was no Christian king, at any rate; he was, rather, some swarthy\ndespot, half Greek, half Asiatic, who in the days when slavery seemed natural\nlooked down on the Mediterranean, on his galley and his groaning slaves. Just\nso, Syme thought, would the brown-gold face of such a tyrant have shown\nagainst the dark green olives and the burning blue.\n\nAre you going to address the meeting? asked the Professor peevishly, seeing\nthat Syme still stood up without moving.\n\nSyme drained his last glass of sparkling wine.\n\nI am, he said, pointing across to the Marquis and his companions, that\nmeeting. That meeting displeases me. I am going to pull that meetings great\nugly, mahogany-coloured nose.\n\nHe stepped across swiftly, if not quite steadily. The Marquis, seeing him,\narched his black Assyrian eyebrows in surprise, but smiled politely.\n\nYou are Mr. Syme, I think, he said.\n\nSyme bowed.\n\nAnd you are the Marquis de Saint Eustache, he said gracefully. Permit me to\npull your nose.\n\nHe leant over to do so, but the Marquis started backwards, upsetting his\nchair, and the two men in top hats held Syme back by the shoulders.\n\nThis man has insulted me! said Syme, with gestures of explanation.\n\nInsulted you? cried the gentleman with the red rosette, when?\n\nOh, just now, said Syme recklessly. He insulted my mother.\n\nInsulted your mother! exclaimed the gentleman incredulously.\n\nWell, anyhow, said Syme, conceding a point, my aunt.\n\nBut how can the Marquis have insulted your aunt just now? said the second\ngentleman with some legitimate wonder. He has been sitting here all the\ntime.\n\nAh, it was what he said! said Syme darkly.\n\nI said nothing at all, said the Marquis, except something about the band. I\nonly said that I liked Wagner played well.\n\nIt was an allusion to my family, said Syme firmly. My aunt played Wagner\nbadly. It was a painful subject. We are always being insulted about it.\n\nThis seems most extraordinary, said the gentleman who was decore, looking\ndoubtfully at the Marquis.\n\nOh, I assure you, said Syme earnestly, the whole of your conversation was\nsimply packed with sinister allusions to my aunts weaknesses.\n\nThis is nonsense! said the second gentleman. I for one have said nothing\nfor half an hour except that I liked the singing of that girl with black\nhair.\n\nWell, there you are again! said Syme indignantly. My aunts was red.\n\nIt seems to me, said the other, that you are simply seeking a pretext to\ninsult the Marquis.\n\nBy George! said Syme, facing round and looking at him, what a clever chap\nyou are!\n\nThe Marquis started up with eyes flaming like a tigers.\n\nSeeking a quarrel with me! he cried. Seeking a fight with me! By God! there\nwas never a man who had to seek long. These gentlemen will perhaps act for me.\nThere are still four hours of daylight. Let us fight this evening.\n\nSyme bowed with a quite beautiful graciousness.\n\nMarquis, he said, your action is worthy of your fame and blood. Permit me\nto consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands I shall place\nmyself.\n\nIn three long strides he rejoined his companions, and they, who had seen his\nchampagne-inspired attack and listened to his idiotic explanations, were quite\nstartled at the look of him. For now that he came back to them he was quite\nsober, a little pale, and he spoke in a low voice of passionate practicality.\n\nI have done it, he said hoarsely. I have fixed a fight on the beast. But\nlook here, and listen carefully. There is no time for talk. You are my\nseconds, and everything must come from you. Now you must insist, and insist\nabsolutely, on the duel coming off after seven tomorrow, so as to give me the\nchance of preventing him from catching the 7.45 for Paris. If he misses that\nhe misses his crime. He cant refuse to meet you on such a small point of time\nand place. But this is what he will do. He will choose a field somewhere near\na wayside station, where he can pick up the train. He is a very good\nswordsman, and he will trust to killing me in time to catch it. But I can\nfence well too, and I think I can keep him in play, at any rate, until the\ntrain is lost. Then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings. You\nunderstand? Very well then, let me introduce you to some charming friends of\nmine, and leading them quickly across the parade, he presented them to the\nMarquiss seconds by two very aristocratic names of which they had not\npreviously heard.\n\nSyme was subject to spasms of singular common sense, not otherwise a part of\nhis character. They were (as he said of his impulse about the spectacles)\npoetic intuitions, and they sometimes rose to the exaltation of prophecy.\n\nHe had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent. When the\nMarquis was informed by his seconds that Syme could only fight in the morning,\nhe must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him\nand his bomb-throwing business in the capital. Naturally he could not explain\nthis objection to his friends, so he chose the course which Syme had\npredicted. He induced his seconds to settle on a small meadow not far from the\nrailway, and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement.\n\nWhen he came down very coolly to the field of honour, no one could have\nguessed that he had any anxiety about a journey; his hands were in his\npockets, his straw hat on the back of his head, his handsome face brazen in\nthe sun. But it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his\ntrain, not only his seconds carrying the sword-case, but two of his servants\ncarrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket.\n\nEarly as was the hour, the sun soaked everything in warmth, and Syme was\nvaguely surprised to see so many spring flowers burning gold and silver in the\ntall grass in which the whole company stood almost knee-deep.\n\nWith the exception of the Marquis, all the men were in sombre and solemn\nmorning-dress, with hats like black chimney-pots; the little Doctor\nespecially, with the addition of his black spectacles, looked like an\nundertaker in a farce. Syme could not help feeling a comic contrast between\nthis funereal church parade of apparel and the rich and glistening meadow,\ngrowing wild flowers everywhere. But, indeed, this comic contrast between the\nyellow blossoms and the black hats was but a symbol of the tragic contrast\nbetween the yellow blossoms and the black business. On his right was a little\nwood; far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line, which he\nwas, so to speak, guarding from the Marquis, whose goal and escape it was. In\nfront of him, behind the black group of his opponents, he could see, like a\ntinted cloud, a small almond bush in flower against the faint line of the sea.\n\nThe member of the Legion of Honour, whose name it seemed was Colonel Ducroix,\napproached the Professor and Dr. Bull with great politeness, and suggested\nthat the play should terminate with the first considerable hurt.\n\nDr. Bull, however, having been carefully coached by Syme upon this point of\npolicy, insisted, with great dignity and in very bad French, that it should\ncontinue until one of the combatants was disabled. Syme had made up his mind\nthat he could avoid disabling the Marquis and prevent the Marquis from\ndisabling him for at least twenty minutes. In twenty minutes the Paris train\nwould have gone by.\n\nTo a man of the well-known skill and valour of Monsieur de St. Eustache,\nsaid the Professor solemnly, it must be a matter of indifference which method\nis adopted, and our principal has strong reasons for demanding the longer\nencounter, reasons the delicacy of which prevent me from being explicit, but\nfor the just and honourable nature of which I can\n\nPeste! broke from the Marquis behind, whose face had suddenly darkened, let\nus stop talking and begin, and he slashed off the head of a tall flower with\nhis stick.\n\nSyme understood his rude impatience and instinctively looked over his shoulder\nto see whether the train was coming in sight. But there was no smoke on the\nhorizon.\n\nColonel Ducroix knelt down and unlocked the case, taking out a pair of twin\nswords, which took the sunlight and turned to two streaks of white fire. He\noffered one to the Marquis, who snatched it without ceremony, and another to\nSyme, who took it, bent it, and poised it with as much delay as was consistent\nwith dignity.\n\nThen the Colonel took out another pair of blades, and taking one himself and\ngiving another to Dr. Bull, proceeded to place the men.\n\nBoth combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats, and stood sword in\nhand. The seconds stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords\nalso, but still sombre in their dark frock-coats and hats. The principals\nsaluted. The Colonel said quietly, Engage! and the two blades touched and\ntingled.\n\nWhen the jar of the joined iron ran up Symes arm, all the fantastic fears\nthat have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man\nwaking up in bed. He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of\nthe nerveshow the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic\naccidents of nightmare, and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of\nthe airless vacuum of science. The first was the old fear that any miracle\nmight happen, the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can\never happen. But he saw that these fears were fancies, for he found himself in\nthe presence of the great fact of the fear of death, with its coarse and\npitiless common sense. He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling\nover precipices, and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged. For\nas soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foes\nforeshortened blade, and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel\ntouch, vibrating like two living things, he knew that his enemy was a terrible\nfighter, and that probably his last hour had come.\n\nHe felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him, in the grass\nunder his feet; he felt the love of life in all living things. He could almost\nfancy that he heard the grass growing; he could almost fancy that even as he\nstood fresh flowers were springing up and breaking into blossom in the\nmeadowflowers blood red and burning gold and blue, fulfilling the whole\npageant of the spring. And whenever his eyes strayed for a flash from the\ncalm, staring, hypnotic eyes of the Marquis, they saw the little tuft of\nalmond tree against the sky-line. He had the feeling that if by some miracle\nhe escaped he would be ready to sit for ever before that almond tree, desiring\nnothing else in the world.\n\nBut while earth and sky and everything had the living beauty of a thing lost,\nthe other half of his head was as clear as glass, and he was parrying his\nenemys point with a kind of clockwork skill of which he had hardly supposed\nhimself capable. Once his enemys point ran along his wrist, leaving a slight\nstreak of blood, but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored. Every\nnow and then he riposted, and once or twice he could almost fancy that he felt\nhis point go home, but as there was no blood on blade or shirt he supposed he\nwas mistaken. Then came an interruption and a change.\n\nAt the risk of losing all, the Marquis, interrupting his quiet stare, flashed\none glance over his shoulder at the line of railway on his right. Then he\nturned on Syme a face transfigured to that of a fiend, and began to fight as\nif with twenty weapons. The attack came so fast and furious, that the one\nshining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows. Syme had no chance to look at\nthe railway; but also he had no need. He could guess the reason of the\nMarquiss sudden madness of battlethe Paris train was in sight.\n\nBut the Marquiss morbid energy over-reached itself. Twice Syme, parrying,\nknocked his opponents point far out of the fighting circle; and the third\ntime his riposte was so rapid, that there was no doubt about the hit this\ntime. Symes sword actually bent under the weight of the Marquiss body, which\nit had pierced.\n\nSyme was as certain that he had stuck his blade into his enemy as a gardener\nthat he has stuck his spade into the ground. Yet the Marquis sprang back from\nthe stroke without a stagger, and Syme stood staring at his own sword-point\nlike an idiot. There was no blood on it at all.\n\nThere was an instant of rigid silence, and then Syme in his turn fell\nfuriously on the other, filled with a flaming curiosity. The Marquis was\nprobably, in a general sense, a better fencer than he, as he had surmised at\nthe beginning, but at the moment the Marquis seemed distraught and at a\ndisadvantage. He fought wildly and even weakly, and he constantly looked away\nat the railway line, almost as if he feared the train more than the pointed\nsteel. Syme, on the other hand, fought fiercely but still carefully, in an\nintellectual fury, eager to solve the riddle of his own bloodless sword. For\nthis purpose, he aimed less at the Marquiss body, and more at his throat and\nhead. A minute and a half afterwards he felt his point enter the mans neck\nbelow the jaw. It came out clean. Half mad, he thrust again, and made what\nshould have been a bloody scar on the Marquiss cheek. But there was no scar.\n\nFor one moment the heaven of Syme again grew black with supernatural terrors.\nSurely the man had a charmed life. But this new spiritual dread was a more\nawful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy-turvydom symbolised by the\nparalytic who pursued him. The Professor was only a goblin; this man was a\ndevilperhaps he was the Devil! Anyhow, this was certain, that three times had\na human sword been driven into him and made no mark. When Syme had that\nthought he drew himself up, and all that was good in him sang high up in the\nair as a high wind sings in the trees. He thought of all the human things in\nhis storyof the Chinese lanterns in Saffron Park, of the girls red hair in\nthe garden, of the honest, beer-swilling sailors down by the dock, of his\nloyal companions standing by. Perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all\nthese fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation.\nAfter all, he said to himself, I am more than a devil; I am a man. I can do\nthe one thing which Satan himself cannot doI can die, and as the word went\nthrough his head, he heard a faint and far-off hoot, which would soon be the\nroar of the Paris train.\n\nHe fell to fighting again with a supernatural levity, like a Mohammedan\npanting for Paradise. As the train came nearer and nearer he fancied he could\nsee people putting up the floral arches in Paris; he joined in the growing\nnoise and the glory of the great Republic whose gate he was guarding against\nHell. His thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train,\nwhich ended, as if proudly, in a long and piercing whistle. The train stopped.\n\nSuddenly, to the astonishment of everyone the Marquis sprang back quite out of\nsword reach and threw down his sword. The leap was wonderful, and not the less\nwonderful because Syme had plunged his sword a moment before into the mans\nthigh.\n\nStop! said the Marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience. I\nwant to say something.\n\nWhat is the matter? asked Colonel Ducroix, staring. Has there been foul\nplay?\n\nThere has been foul play somewhere, said Dr. Bull, who was a little pale.\nOur principal has wounded the Marquis four times at least, and he is none the\nworse.\n\nThe Marquis put up his hand with a curious air of ghastly patience.\n\nPlease let me speak, he said. It is rather important. Mr. Syme, he\ncontinued, turning to his opponent, we are fighting today, if I remember\nright, because you expressed a wish (which I thought irrational) to pull my\nnose. Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now as quickly as possible? I\nhave to catch a train.\n\nI protest that this is most irregular, said Dr. Bull indignantly.\n\nIt is certainly somewhat opposed to precedent, said Colonel Ducroix, looking\nwistfully at his principal. There is, I think, one case on record (Captain\nBellegarde and the Baron Zumpt) in which the weapons were changed in the\nmiddle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants. But one can\nhardly call ones nose a weapon.\n\nWill you or will you not pull my nose? said the Marquis in exasperation.\nCome, come, Mr. Syme! You wanted to do it, do it! You can have no conception\nof how important it is to me. Dont be so selfish! Pull my nose at once, when\nI ask you! and he bent slightly forward with a fascinating smile. The Paris\ntrain, panting and groaning, had grated into a little station behind the\nneighbouring hill.\n\nSyme had the feeling he had more than once had in these adventuresthe sense\nthat a horrible and sublime wave lifted to heaven was just toppling over.\nWalking in a world he half understood, he took two paces forward and seized\nthe Roman nose of this remarkable nobleman. He pulled it hard, and it came off\nin his hand.\n\nHe stood for some seconds with a foolish solemnity, with the pasteboard\nproboscis still between his fingers, looking at it, while the sun and the\nclouds and the wooded hills looked down upon this imbecile scene.\n\nThe Marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice.\n\nIf anyone has any use for my left eyebrow, he said, he can have it. Colonel\nDucroix, do accept my left eyebrow! Its the kind of thing that might come in\nuseful any day, and he gravely tore off one of his swarthy Assyrian brows,\nbringing about half his brown forehead with it, and politely offered it to the\nColonel, who stood crimson and speechless with rage.\n\nIf I had known, he spluttered, that I was acting for a poltroon who pads\nhimself to fight\n\nOh, I know, I know! said the Marquis, recklessly throwing various parts of\nhimself right and left about the field. You are making a mistake; but it\ncant be explained just now. I tell you the train has come into the station!\n\nYes, said Dr. Bull fiercely, and the train shall go out of the station. It\nshall go out without you. We know well enough for what devils work\n\nThe mysterious Marquis lifted his hands with a desperate gesture. He was a\nstrange scarecrow standing there in the sun with half his old face peeled off,\nand half another face glaring and grinning from underneath.\n\nWill you drive me mad? he cried. The train\n\nYou shall not go by the train, said Syme firmly, and grasped his sword.\n\nThe wild figure turned towards Syme, and seemed to be gathering itself for a\nsublime effort before speaking.\n\nYou great fat, blasted, blear-eyed, blundering, thundering, brainless,\nGodforsaken, doddering, damned fool! he said without taking breath. You\ngreat silly, pink-faced, towheaded turnip! You\n\nYou shall not go by this train, repeated Syme.\n\nAnd why the infernal blazes, roared the other, should I want to go by the\ntrain?\n\nWe know all, said the Professor sternly. You are going to Paris to throw a\nbomb!\n\nGoing to Jericho to throw a Jabberwock! cried the other, tearing his hair,\nwhich came off easily.\n\nHave you all got softening of the brain, that you dont realise what I am?\nDid you really think I wanted to catch that train? Twenty Paris trains might\ngo by for me. Damn Paris trains!\n\nThen what did you care about? began the Professor.\n\nWhat did I care about? I didnt care about catching the train; I cared about\nwhether the train caught me, and now, by God! it has caught me.\n\nI regret to inform you, said Syme with restraint, that your remarks convey\nno impression to my mind. Perhaps if you were to remove the remains of your\noriginal forehead and some portion of what was once your chin, your meaning\nwould become clearer. Mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways. What do you\nmean by saying that the train has caught you? It may be my literary fancy, but\nsomehow I feel that it ought to mean something.\n\nIt means everything, said the other, and the end of everything. Sunday has\nus now in the hollow of his hand.\n\nUs! repeated the Professor, as if stupefied. What do you mean by us?\n\nThe police, of course! said the Marquis, and tore off his scalp and half his\nface.\n\nThe head which emerged was the blonde, well brushed, smooth-haired head which\nis common in the English constabulary, but the face was terribly pale.\n\nI am Inspector Ratcliffe, he said, with a sort of haste that verged on\nharshness. My name is pretty well known to the police, and I can see well\nenough that you belong to them. But if there is any doubt about my position, I\nhave a card, and he began to pull a blue card from his pocket.\n\nThe Professor gave a tired gesture.\n\nOh, dont show it us, he said wearily; weve got enough of them to equip a\npaper-chase.\n\nThe little man named Bull, had, like many men who seem to be of a mere\nvivacious vulgarity, sudden movements of good taste. Here he certainly saved\nthe situation. In the midst of this staggering transformation scene he stepped\nforward with all the gravity and responsibility of a second, and addressed the\ntwo seconds of the Marquis.\n\nGentlemen, he said, we all owe you a serious apology; but I assure you that\nyou have not been made the victims of such a low joke as you imagine, or\nindeed of anything undignified in a man of honour. You have not wasted your\ntime; you have helped to save the world. We are not buffoons, but very\ndesperate men at war with a vast conspiracy. A secret society of anarchists is\nhunting us like hares; not such unfortunate madmen as may here or there throw\na bomb through starvation or German philosophy, but a rich and powerful and\nfanatical church, a church of eastern pessimism, which holds it holy to\ndestroy mankind like vermin. How hard they hunt us you can gather from the\nfact that we are driven to such disguises as those for which I apologise, and\nto such pranks as this one by which you suffer.\n\nThe younger second of the Marquis, a short man with a black moustache, bowed\npolitely, and said\n\nOf course, I accept the apology; but you will in your turn forgive me if I\ndecline to follow you further into your difficulties, and permit myself to say\ngood morning! The sight of an acquaintance and distinguished fellow-townsman\ncoming to pieces in the open air is unusual, and, upon the whole, sufficient\nfor one day. Colonel Ducroix, I would in no way influence your actions, but if\nyou feel with me that our present society is a little abnormal, I am now going\nto walk back to the town.\n\nColonel Ducroix moved mechanically, but then tugged abruptly at his white\nmoustache and broke out\n\nNo, by George! I wont. If these gentlemen are really in a mess with a lot of\nlow wreckers like that, Ill see them through it. I have fought for France,\nand it is hard if I cant fight for civilization.\n\nDr. Bull took off his hat and waved it, cheering as at a public meeting.\n\nDont make too much noise, said Inspector Ratcliffe, Sunday may hear you.\n\nSunday! cried Bull, and dropped his hat.\n\nYes, retorted Ratcliffe, he may be with them.\n\nWith whom? asked Syme.\n\nWith the people out of that train, said the other.\n\nWhat you say seems utterly wild, began Syme. Why, as a matter of factBut,\nmy God, he cried out suddenly, like a man who sees an explosion a long way\noff, by God! if this is true the whole bally lot of us on the Anarchist\nCouncil were against anarchy! Every born man was a detective except the\nPresident and his personal secretary. What can it mean?\n\nMean! said the new policeman with incredible violence. It means that we are\nstruck dead! Dont you know Sunday? Dont you know that his jokes are always\nso big and simple that one has never thought of them? Can you think of\nanything more like Sunday than this, that he should put all his powerful\nenemies on the Supreme Council, and then take care that it was not supreme? I\ntell you he has bought every trust, he has captured every cable, he has\ncontrol of every railway lineespecially of that railway line! and he pointed\na shaking finger towards the small wayside station. The whole movement was\ncontrolled by him; half the world was ready to rise for him. But there were\njust five people, perhaps, who would have resisted him... and the old devil\nput them on the Supreme Council, to waste their time in watching each other.\nIdiots that we are, he planned the whole of our idiocies! Sunday knew that the\nProfessor would chase Syme through London, and that Syme would fight me in\nFrance. And he was combining great masses of capital, and seizing great lines\nof telegraphy, while we five idiots were running after each other like a lot\nof confounded babies playing blind mans buff.\n\nWell? asked Syme with a sort of steadiness.\n\nWell, replied the other with sudden serenity, he has found us playing blind\nmans buff today in a field of great rustic beauty and extreme solitude. He\nhas probably captured the world; it only remains to him to capture this field\nand all the fools in it. And since you really want to know what was my\nobjection to the arrival of that train, I will tell you. My objection was that\nSunday or his Secretary has just this moment got out of it.\n\nSyme uttered an involuntary cry, and they all turned their eyes towards the\nfar-off station. It was quite true that a considerable bulk of people seemed\nto be moving in their direction. But they were too distant to be distinguished\nin any way.\n\nIt was a habit of the late Marquis de St. Eustache, said the new policeman,\nproducing a leather case, always to carry a pair of opera glasses. Either the\nPresident or the Secretary is coming after us with that mob. They have caught\nus in a nice quiet place where we are under no temptations to break our oaths\nby calling the police. Dr. Bull, I have a suspicion that you will see better\nthrough these than through your own highly decorative spectacles.\n\nHe handed the field-glasses to the Doctor, who immediately took off his\nspectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes.\n\nIt cannot be as bad as you say, said the Professor, somewhat shaken. There\nare a good number of them certainly, but they may easily be ordinary\ntourists.\n\nDo ordinary tourists, asked Bull, with the fieldglasses to his eyes, wear\nblack masks half-way down the face?\n\nSyme almost tore the glasses out of his hand, and looked through them. Most\nmen in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough; but it was quite true\nthat two or three of the leaders in front wore black half-masks almost down to\ntheir mouths. This disguise is very complete, especially at such a distance,\nand Syme found it impossible to conclude anything from the clean-shaven jaws\nand chins of the men talking in the front. But presently as they talked they\nall smiled and one of them smiled on one side.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER XI. THE CRIMINALS CHASE THE POLICE\n\nSYME put the field-glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly relief.\n\nThe President is not with them, anyhow, he said, and wiped his forehead.\n\nBut surely they are right away on the horizon, said the bewildered Colonel,\nblinking and but half recovered from Bulls hasty though polite explanation.\nCould you possibly know your President among all those people?\n\nCould I know a white elephant among all those people! answered Syme somewhat\nirritably. As you very truly say, they are on the horizon; but if he were\nwalking with them... by God! I believe this ground would shake.\n\nAfter an instants pause the new man called Ratcliffe said with gloomy\ndecision\n\nOf course the President isnt with them. I wish to Gemini he were. Much more\nlikely the President is riding in triumph through Paris, or sitting on the\nruins of St. Pauls Cathedral.\n\nThis is absurd! said Syme. Something may have happened in our absence; but\nhe cannot have carried the world with a rush like that. It is quite true, he\nadded, frowning dubiously at the distant fields that lay towards the little\nstation, it is certainly true that there seems to be a crowd coming this way;\nbut they are not all the army that you make out.\n\nOh, they, said the new detective contemptuously; no they are not a very\nvaluable force. But let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated\nto our valuewe are not much, my boy, in Sundays universe. He has got hold of\nall the cables and telegraphs himself. But to kill the Supreme Council he\nregards as a trivial matter, like a post card; it may be left to his private\nsecretary, and he spat on the grass.\n\nThen he turned to the others and said somewhat austerely\n\nThere is a great deal to be said for death; but if anyone has any preference\nfor the other alternative, I strongly advise him to walk after me.\n\nWith these words, he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy\ntowards the wood. The others gave one glance over their shoulders, and saw\nthat the dark cloud of men had detached itself from the station and was moving\nwith a mysterious discipline across the plain. They saw already, even with the\nnaked eye, black blots on the foremost faces, which marked the masks they\nwore. They turned and followed their leader, who had already struck the wood,\nand disappeared among the twinkling trees.\n\nThe sun on the grass was dry and hot. So in plunging into the wood they had a\ncool shock of shadow, as of divers who plunge into a dim pool. The inside of\nthe wood was full of shattered sunlight and shaken shadows. They made a sort\nof shuddering veil, almost recalling the dizziness of a cinematograph. Even\nthe solid figures walking with him Syme could hardly see for the patterns of\nsun and shade that danced upon them. Now a mans head was lit as with a light\nof Rembrandt, leaving all else obliterated; now again he had strong and\nstaring white hands with the face of a negro. The ex-Marquis had pulled the\nold straw hat over his eyes, and the black shade of the brim cut his face so\nsquarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half-masks of\ntheir pursuers. The fancy tinted Symes overwhelming sense of wonder. Was he\nwearing a mask? Was anyone wearing a mask? Was anyone anything? This wood of\nwitchery, in which mens faces turned black and white by turns, in which their\nfigures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night, this\nmere chaos of chiaroscuro (after the clear daylight outside), seemed to Syme a\nperfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for three days, this\nworld where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses,\nand turned into other people. That tragic self-confidence which he had felt\nwhen he believed that the Marquis was a devil had strangely disappeared now\nthat he knew that the Marquis was a friend. He felt almost inclined to ask\nafter all these bewilderments what was a friend and what an enemy. Was there\nanything that was apart from what it seemed? The Marquis had taken off his\nnose and turned out to be a detective. Might he not just as well take off his\nhead and turn out to be a hobgoblin? Was not everything, after all, like this\nbewildering woodland, this dance of dark and light? Everything only a glimpse,\nthe glimpse always unforeseen, and always forgotten. For Gabriel Syme had\nfound in the heart of that sun-splashed wood what many modern painters had\nfound there. He had found the thing which the modern people call\nImpressionism, which is another name for that final scepticism which can find\nno floor to the universe.\n\nAs a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake, Syme strove with\na sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies. With two\nimpatient strides he overtook the man in the Marquiss straw hat, the man whom\nhe had come to address as Ratcliffe. In a voice exaggeratively loud and\ncheerful, he broke the bottomless silence and made conversation.\n\nMay I ask, he said, where on earth we are all going to?\n\nSo genuine had been the doubts of his soul, that he was quite glad to hear his\ncompanion speak in an easy, human voice.\n\nWe must get down through the town of Lancy to the sea, he said. I think\nthat part of the country is least likely to be with them.\n\nWhat can you mean by all this? cried Syme. They cant be running the real\nworld in that way. Surely not many working men are anarchists, and surely if\nthey were, mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police.\n\nMere mobs! repeated his new friend with a snort of scorn. So you talk about\nmobs and the working classes as if they were the question. Youve got that\neternal idiotic idea that if anarchy came it would come from the poor. Why\nshould it? The poor have been rebels, but they have never been anarchists;\nthey have more interest than anyone else in there being some decent\ngovernment. The poor man really has a stake in the country. The rich man\nhasnt; he can go away to New Guinea in a yacht. The poor have sometimes\nobjected to being governed badly; the rich have always objected to being\ngoverned at all. Aristocrats were always anarchists, as you can see from the\nbarons wars.\n\nAs a lecture on English history for the little ones, said Syme, this is all\nvery nice; but I have not yet grasped its application.\n\nIts application is, said his informant, that most of old Sundays right-\nhand men are South African and American millionaires. That is why he has got\nhold of all the communications; and that is why the last four champions of the\nanti-anarchist police force are running through a wood like rabbits.\n\nMillionaires I can understand, said Syme thoughtfully, they are nearly all\nmad. But getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing;\ngetting hold of great Christian nations is another. I would bet the nose off\nmy face (forgive the allusion) that Sunday would stand perfectly helpless\nbefore the task of converting any ordinary healthy person anywhere.\n\nWell, said the other, it rather depends what sort of person you mean.\n\nWell, for instance, said Syme, he could never convert that person, and he\npointed straight in front of him.\n\nThey had come to an open space of sunlight, which seemed to express to Syme\nthe final return of his own good sense; and in the middle of this forest\nclearing was a figure that might well stand for that common sense in an almost\nawful actuality. Burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration, and grave\nwith the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils, a heavy French peasant\nwas cutting wood with a hatchet. His cart stood a few yards off, already half\nfull of timber; and the horse that cropped the grass was, like his master,\nvalorous but not desperate; like his master, he was even prosperous, but yet\nwas almost sad. The man was a Norman, taller than the average of the French\nand very angular; and his swarthy figure stood dark against a square of\nsunlight, almost like some allegoric figure of labour frescoed on a ground of\ngold.\n\nMr. Syme is saying, called out Ratcliffe to the French Colonel, that this\nman, at least, will never be an anarchist.\n\nMr. Syme is right enough there, answered Colonel Ducroix, laughing, if only\nfor the reason that he has plenty of property to defend. But I forgot that in\nyour country you are not used to peasants being wealthy.\n\nHe looks poor, said Dr. Bull doubtfully.\n\nQuite so, said the Colonel; that is why he is rich.\n\nI have an idea, called out Dr. Bull suddenly; how much would he take to\ngive us a lift in his cart? Those dogs are all on foot, and we could soon\nleave them behind.\n\nOh, give him anything! said Syme eagerly. I have piles of money on me.\n\nThat will never do, said the Colonel; he will never have any respect for\nyou unless you drive a bargain.\n\nOh, if he haggles! began Bull impatiently.\n\nHe haggles because he is a free man, said the other. You do not understand;\nhe would not see the meaning of generosity. He is not being tipped.\n\nAnd even while they seemed to hear the heavy feet of their strange pursuers\nbehind them, they had to stand and stamp while the French Colonel talked to\nthe French wood-cutter with all the leisurely badinage and bickering of\nmarket-day. At the end of the four minutes, however, they saw that the Colonel\nwas right, for the wood-cutter entered into their plans, not with the vague\nservility of a tout too-well paid, but with the seriousness of a solicitor who\nhad been paid the proper fee. He told them that the best thing they could do\nwas to make their way down to the little inn on the hills above Lancy, where\nthe innkeeper, an old soldier who had become devout in his latter years, would\nbe certain to sympathise with them, and even to take risks in their support.\nThe whole company, therefore, piled themselves on top of the stacks of wood,\nand went rocking in the rude cart down the other and steeper side of the\nwoodland. Heavy and ramshackle as was the vehicle, it was driven quickly\nenough, and they soon had the exhilarating impression of distancing altogether\nthose, whoever they were, who were hunting them. For, after all, the riddle as\nto where the anarchists had got all these followers was still unsolved. One\nmans presence had sufficed for them; they had fled at the first sight of the\ndeformed smile of the Secretary. Syme every now and then looked back over his\nshoulder at the army on their track.\n\nAs the wood grew first thinner and then smaller with distance, he could see\nthe sunlit slopes beyond it and above it; and across these was still moving\nthe square black mob like one monstrous beetle. In the very strong sunlight\nand with his own very strong eyes, which were almost telescopic, Syme could\nsee this mass of men quite plainly. He could see them as separate human\nfigures; but he was increasingly surprised by the way in which they moved as\none man. They seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats, like any\ncommon crowd out of the streets; but they did not spread and sprawl and trail\nby various lines to the attack, as would be natural in an ordinary mob. They\nmoved with a sort of dreadful and wicked woodenness, like a staring army of\nautomatons.\n\nSyme pointed this out to Ratcliffe.\n\nYes, replied the policeman, thats discipline. Thats Sunday. He is perhaps\nfive hundred miles off, but the fear of him is on all of them, like the finger\nof God. Yes, they are walking regularly; and you bet your boots that they are\ntalking regularly, yes, and thinking regularly. But the one important thing\nfor us is that they are disappearing regularly.\n\nSyme nodded. It was true that the black patch of the pursuing men was growing\nsmaller and smaller as the peasant belaboured his horse.\n\nThe level of the sunlit landscape, though flat as a whole, fell away on the\nfarther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea, in a way\nnot unlike the lower slopes of the Sussex downs. The only difference was that\nin Sussex the road would have been broken and angular like a little brook, but\nhere the white French road fell sheer in front of them like a waterfall. Down\nthis direct descent the cart clattered at a considerable angle, and in a few\nminutes, the road growing yet steeper, they saw below them the little harbour\nof Lancy and a great blue arc of the sea. The travelling cloud of their\nenemies had wholly disappeared from the horizon.\n\nThe horse and cart took a sharp turn round a clump of elms, and the horses\nnose nearly struck the face of an old gentleman who was sitting on the benches\noutside the little cafe of Le Soleil dOr. The peasant grunted an apology,\nand got down from his seat. The others also descended one by one, and spoke to\nthe old gentleman with fragmentary phrases of courtesy, for it was quite\nevident from his expansive manner that he was the owner of the little tavern.\n\nHe was a white-haired, apple-faced old boy, with sleepy eyes and a grey\nmoustache; stout, sedentary, and very innocent, of a type that may often be\nfound in France, but is still commoner in Catholic Germany. Everything about\nhim, his pipe, his pot of beer, his flowers, and his beehive, suggested an\nancestral peace; only when his visitors looked up as they entered the inn-\nparlour, they saw the sword upon the wall.\n\nThe Colonel, who greeted the innkeeper as an old friend, passed rapidly into\nthe inn-parlour, and sat down ordering some ritual refreshment. The military\ndecision of his action interested Syme, who sat next to him, and he took the\nopportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity.\n\nMay I ask you, Colonel, he said in a low voice, why we have come here?\n\nColonel Ducroix smiled behind his bristly white moustache.\n\nFor two reasons, sir, he said; and I will give first, not the most\nimportant, but the most utilitarian. We came here because this is the only\nplace within twenty miles in which we can get horses.\n\nHorses! repeated Syme, looking up quickly.\n\nYes, replied the other; if you people are really to distance your enemies\nit is horses or nothing for you, unless of course you have bicycles and motor-\ncars in your pocket.\n\nAnd where do you advise us to make for? asked Syme doubtfully.\n\nBeyond question, replied the Colonel, you had better make all haste to the\npolice station beyond the town. My friend, whom I seconded under somewhat\ndeceptive circumstances, seems to me to exaggerate very much the possibilities\nof a general rising; but even he would hardly maintain, I suppose, that you\nwere not safe with the gendarmes.\n\nSyme nodded gravely; then he said abruptly\n\nAnd your other reason for coming here?\n\nMy other reason for coming here, said Ducroix soberly, is that it is just\nas well to see a good man or two when one is possibly near to death.\n\nSyme looked up at the wall, and saw a crudely-painted and pathetic religious\npicture. Then he said\n\nYou are right, and then almost immediately afterwards, Has anyone seen\nabout the horses?\n\nYes, answered Ducroix, you may be quite certain that I gave orders the\nmoment I came in. Those enemies of yours gave no impression of hurry, but they\nwere really moving wonderfully fast, like a well-trained army. I had no idea\nthat the anarchists had so much discipline. You have not a moment to waste.\n\nAlmost as he spoke, the old innkeeper with the blue eyes and white hair came\nambling into the room, and announced that six horses were saddled outside.\n\nBy Ducroixs advice the five others equipped themselves with some portable\nform of food and wine, and keeping their duelling swords as the only weapons\navailable, they clattered away down the steep, white road. The two servants,\nwho had carried the Marquiss luggage when he was a marquis, were left behind\nto drink at the cafe by common consent, and not at all against their own\ninclination.\n\nBy this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward, and by its rays Syme\ncould see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller,\nbut still standing and looking after them quite silently, the sunshine in his\nsilver hair. Syme had a fixed, superstitious fancy, left in his mind by the\nchance phrase of the Colonel, that this was indeed, perhaps, the last honest\nstranger whom he should ever see upon the earth.\n\nHe was still looking at this dwindling figure, which stood as a mere grey blot\ntouched with a white flame against the great green wall of the steep down\nbehind him. And as he stared over the top of the down behind the innkeeper,\nthere appeared an army of black-clad and marching men. They seemed to hang\nabove the good man and his house like a black cloud of locusts. The horses had\nbeen saddled none too soon.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER XII. THE EARTH IN ANARCHY\n\nURGING the horses to a gallop, without respect to the rather rugged descent of\nthe road, the horsemen soon regained their advantage over the men on the\nmarch, and at last the bulk of the first buildings of Lancy cut off the sight\nof their pursuers. Nevertheless, the ride had been a long one, and by the time\nthey reached the real town the west was warming with the colour and quality of\nsunset. The Colonel suggested that, before making finally for the police\nstation, they should make the effort, in passing, to attach to themselves one\nmore individual who might be useful.\n\nFour out of the five rich men in this town, he said, are common swindlers.\nI suppose the proportion is pretty equal all over the world. The fifth is a\nfriend of mine, and a very fine fellow; and what is even more important from\nour point of view, he owns a motor-car.\n\nI am afraid, said the Professor in his mirthful way, looking back along the\nwhite road on which the black, crawling patch might appear at any moment, I\nam afraid we have hardly time for afternoon calls.\n\nDoctor Renards house is only three minutes off, said the Colonel.\n\nOur danger, said Dr. Bull, is not two minutes off.\n\nYes, said Syme, if we ride on fast we must leave them behind, for they are\non foot.\n\nHe has a motor-car, said the Colonel.\n\nBut we may not get it, said Bull.\n\nYes, he is quite on your side.\n\nBut he might be out.\n\nHold your tongue, said Syme suddenly. What is that noise?\n\nFor a second they all sat as still as equestrian statues, and for a secondfor\ntwo or three or four secondsheaven and earth seemed equally still. Then all\ntheir ears, in an agony of attention, heard along the road that indescribable\nthrill and throb that means only one thinghorses!\n\nThe Colonels face had an instantaneous change, as if lightning had struck it,\nand yet left it scatheless.\n\nThey have done us, he said, with brief military irony. Prepare to receive\ncavalry!\n\nWhere can they have got the horses? asked Syme, as he mechanically urged his\nsteed to a canter.\n\nThe Colonel was silent for a little, then he said in a strained voice\n\nI was speaking with strict accuracy when I said that the Soleil dOr was\nthe only place where one can get horses within twenty miles.\n\nNo! said Syme violently, I dont believe hed do it. Not with all that\nwhite hair.\n\nHe may have been forced, said the Colonel gently. They must be at least a\nhundred strong, for which reason we are all going to see my friend Renard, who\nhas a motor-car.\n\nWith these words he swung his horse suddenly round a street corner, and went\ndown the street with such thundering speed, that the others, though already\nwell at the gallop, had difficulty in following the flying tail of his horse.\n\nDr. Renard inhabited a high and comfortable house at the top of a steep\nstreet, so that when the riders alighted at his door they could once more see\nthe solid green ridge of the hill, with the white road across it, standing up\nabove all the roofs of the town. They breathed again to see that the road as\nyet was clear, and they rang the bell.\n\nDr. Renard was a beaming, brown-bearded man, a good example of that silent but\nvery busy professional class which France has preserved even more perfectly\nthan England. When the matter was explained to him he pooh-poohed the panic of\nthe ex-Marquis altogether; he said, with the solid French scepticism, that\nthere was no conceivable probability of a general anarchist rising. Anarchy,\nhe said, shrugging his shoulders, it is childishness!\n\nEt ca, cried out the Colonel suddenly, pointing over the others shoulder,\nand that is childishness, isnt it?\n\nThey all looked round, and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the\ntop of the hill with all the energy of Attila. Swiftly as they rode, however,\nthe whole rank still kept well together, and they could see the black vizards\nof the first line as level as a line of uniforms. But although the main black\nsquare was the same, though travelling faster, there was now one sensational\ndifference which they could see clearly upon the slope of the hill, as if upon\na slanted map. The bulk of the riders were in one block; but one rider flew\nfar ahead of the column, and with frantic movements of hand and heel urged his\nhorse faster and faster, so that one might have fancied that he was not the\npursuer but the pursued. But even at that great distance they could see\nsomething so fanatical, so unquestionable in his figure, that they knew it was\nthe Secretary himself. I am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion, said\nthe Colonel, but can you lend me your motor-car now, in two minutes?\n\nI have a suspicion that you are all mad, said Dr. Renard, smiling sociably;\nbut God forbid that madness should in any way interrupt friendship. Let us go\nround to the garage.\n\nDr. Renard was a mild man with monstrous wealth; his rooms were like the Musee\nde Cluny, and he had three motor-cars. These, however, he seemed to use very\nsparingly, having the simple tastes of the French middle class, and when his\nimpatient friends came to examine them, it took them some time to assure\nthemselves that one of them even could be made to work. This with some\ndifficulty they brought round into the street before the Doctors house. When\nthey came out of the dim garage they were startled to find that twilight had\nalready fallen with the abruptness of night in the tropics. Either they had\nbeen longer in the place than they imagined, or some unusual canopy of cloud\nhad gathered over the town. They looked down the steep streets, and seemed to\nsee a slight mist coming up from the sea.\n\nIt is now or never, said Dr. Bull. I hear horses.\n\nNo, corrected the Professor, a horse.\n\nAnd as they listened, it was evident that the noise, rapidly coming nearer on\nthe rattling stones, was not the noise of the whole cavalcade but that of the\none horseman, who had left it far behindthe insane Secretary.\n\nSymes family, like most of those who end in the simple life, had once owned a\nmotor, and he knew all about them. He had leapt at once into the chauffeurs\nseat, and with flushed face was wrenching and tugging at the disused\nmachinery. He bent his strength upon one handle, and then said quite quietly\n\nI am afraid its no go.\n\nAs he spoke, there swept round the corner a man rigid on his rushing horse,\nwith the rush and rigidity of an arrow. He had a smile that thrust out his\nchin as if it were dislocated. He swept alongside of the stationary car, into\nwhich its company had crowded, and laid his hand on the front. It was the\nSecretary, and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph.\n\nSyme was leaning hard upon the steering wheel, and there was no sound but the\nrumble of the other pursuers riding into the town. Then there came quite\nsuddenly a scream of scraping iron, and the car leapt forward. It plucked the\nSecretary clean out of his saddle, as a knife is whipped out of its sheath,\ntrailed him kicking terribly for twenty yards, and left him flung flat upon\nthe road far in front of his frightened horse. As the car took the corner of\nthe street with a splendid curve, they could just see the other anarchists\nfilling the street and raising their fallen leader.\n\nI cant understand why it has grown so dark, said the Professor at last in a\nlow voice.\n\nGoing to be a storm, I think, said Dr. Bull. I say, its a pity we havent\ngot a light on this car, if only to see by.\n\nWe have, said the Colonel, and from the floor of the car he fished up a\nheavy, old-fashioned, carved iron lantern with a light inside it. It was\nobviously an antique, and it would seem as if its original use had been in\nsome way semi-religious, for there was a rude moulding of a cross upon one of\nits sides.\n\nWhere on earth did you get that? asked the Professor.\n\nI got it where I got the car, answered the Colonel, chuckling, from my best\nfriend. While our friend here was fighting with the steering wheel, I ran up\nthe front steps of the house and spoke to Renard, who was standing in his own\nporch, you will remember. I suppose, I said, theres no time to get a\nlamp. He looked up, blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his\nown front hall. From this was suspended, by chains of exquisite ironwork, this\nlantern, one of the hundred treasures of his treasure house. By sheer force he\ntore the lamp out of his own ceiling, shattering the painted panels, and\nbringing down two blue vases with his violence. Then he handed me the iron\nlantern, and I put it in the car. Was I not right when I said that Dr. Renard\nwas worth knowing?\n\nYou were, said Syme seriously, and hung the heavy lantern over the front.\nThere was a certain allegory of their whole position in the contrast between\nthe modern automobile and its strange ecclesiastical lamp. Hitherto they had\npassed through the quietest part of the town, meeting at most one or two\npedestrians, who could give them no hint of the peace or the hostility of the\nplace. Now, however, the windows in the houses began one by one to be lit up,\ngiving a greater sense of habitation and humanity. Dr. Bull turned to the new\ndetective who had led their flight, and permitted himself one of his natural\nand friendly smiles.\n\nThese lights make one feel more cheerful.\n\nInspector Ratcliffe drew his brows together.\n\nThere is only one set of lights that make me more cheerful, he said, and\nthey are those lights of the police station which I can see beyond the town.\nPlease God we may be there in ten minutes.\n\nThen all Bulls boiling good sense and optimism broke suddenly out of him.\n\nOh, this is all raving nonsense! he cried. If you really think that\nordinary people in ordinary houses are anarchists, you must be madder than an\nanarchist yourself. If we turned and fought these fellows, the whole town\nwould fight for us.\n\nNo, said the other with an immovable simplicity, the whole town would fight\nfor them. We shall see.\n\nWhile they were speaking the Professor had leant forward with sudden\nexcitement.\n\nWhat is that noise? he said.\n\nOh, the horses behind us, I suppose, said the Colonel. I thought we had got\nclear of them.\n\nThe horses behind us! No, said the Professor, it is not horses, and it is\nnot behind us.\n\nAlmost as he spoke, across the end of the street before them two shining and\nrattling shapes shot past. They were gone almost in a flash, but everyone\ncould see that they were motor-cars, and the Professor stood up with a pale\nface and swore that they were the other two motor-cars from Dr. Renards\ngarage.\n\nI tell you they were his, he repeated, with wild eyes, and they were full\nof men in masks!\n\nAbsurd! said the Colonel angrily. Dr. Renard would never give them his\ncars.\n\nHe may have been forced, said Ratcliffe quietly. The whole town is on their\nside.\n\nYou still believe that, asked the Colonel incredulously.\n\nYou will all believe it soon, said the other with a hopeless calm.\n\nThere was a puzzled pause for some little time, and then the Colonel began\nagain abruptly\n\nNo, I cant believe it. The thing is nonsense. The plain people of a\npeaceable French town\n\nHe was cut short by a bang and a blaze of light, which seemed close to his\neyes. As the car sped on it left a floating patch of white smoke behind it,\nand Syme had heard a shot shriek past his ear.\n\nMy God! said the Colonel, someone has shot at us.\n\nIt need not interrupt conversation, said the gloomy Ratcliffe. Pray resume\nyour remarks, Colonel. You were talking, I think, about the plain people of a\npeaceable French town.\n\nThe staring Colonel was long past minding satire. He rolled his eyes all round\nthe street.\n\nIt is extraordinary, he said, most extraordinary.\n\nA fastidious person, said Syme, might even call it unpleasant. However, I\nsuppose those lights out in the field beyond this street are the Gendarmerie.\nWe shall soon get there.\n\nNo, said Inspector Ratcliffe, we shall never get there.\n\nHe had been standing up and looking keenly ahead of him. Now he sat down and\nsmoothed his sleek hair with a weary gesture.\n\nWhat do you mean? asked Bull sharply.\n\nI mean that we shall never get there, said the pessimist placidly. They\nhave two rows of armed men across the road already; I can see them from here.\nThe town is in arms, as I said it was. I can only wallow in the exquisite\ncomfort of my own exactitude.\n\nAnd Ratcliffe sat down comfortably in the car and lit a cigarette, but the\nothers rose excitedly and stared down the road. Syme had slowed down the car\nas their plans became doubtful, and he brought it finally to a standstill just\nat the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea.\n\nThe town was mostly in shadow, but the sun had not sunk; wherever its level\nlight could break through, it painted everything a burning gold. Up this side\nstreet the last sunset light shone as sharp and narrow as the shaft of\nartificial light at the theatre. It struck the car of the five friends, and\nlit it like a burning chariot. But the rest of the street, especially the two\nends of it, was in the deepest twilight, and for some seconds they could see\nnothing. Then Syme, whose eyes were the keenest, broke into a little bitter\nwhistle, and said,\n\nIt is quite true. There is a crowd or an army or some such thing across the\nend of that street.\n\nWell, if there is, said Bull impatiently, it must be something elsea sham\nfight or the mayors birthday or something. I cannot and will not believe that\nplain, jolly people in a place like this walk about with dynamite in their\npockets. Get on a bit, Syme, and let us look at them.\n\nThe car crawled about a hundred yards farther, and then they were all startled\nby Dr. Bull breaking into a high crow of laughter.\n\nWhy, you silly mugs! he cried, what did I tell you. That crowds as law-\nabiding as a cow, and if it werent, its on our side.\n\nHow do you know? asked the professor, staring.\n\nYou blind bat, cried Bull, dont you see who is leading them?\n\nThey peered again, and then the Colonel, with a catch in his voice, cried out\n\nWhy, its Renard!\n\nThere was, indeed, a rank of dim figures running across the road, and they\ncould not be clearly seen; but far enough in front to catch the accident of\nthe evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable Dr. Renard, in a\nwhite hat, stroking his long brown beard, and holding a revolver in his left\nhand.\n\nWhat a fool Ive been! exclaimed the Colonel. Of course, the dear old boy\nhas turned out to help us.\n\nDr. Bull was bubbling over with laughter, swinging the sword in his hand as\ncarelessly as a cane. He jumped out of the car and ran across the intervening\nspace, calling out\n\nDr. Renard! Dr. Renard!\n\nAn instant after Syme thought his own eyes had gone mad in his head. For the\nphilanthropic Dr. Renard had deliberately raised his revolver and fired twice\nat Bull, so that the shots rang down the road.\n\nAlmost at the same second as the puff of white cloud went up from this\natrocious explosion a long puff of white cloud went up also from the cigarette\nof the cynical Ratcliffe. Like all the rest he turned a little pale, but he\nsmiled. Dr. Bull, at whom the bullets had been fired, just missing his scalp,\nstood quite still in the middle of the road without a sign of fear, and then\nturned very slowly and crawled back to the car, and climbed in with two holes\nthrough his hat.\n\nWell, said the cigarette smoker slowly, what do you think now?\n\nI think, said Dr. Bull with precision, that I am lying in bed at No. 217\nPeabody Buildings, and that I shall soon wake up with a jump; or, if thats\nnot it, I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell, and\nthat the doctor cant make much of my case. But if you want to know what I\ndont think, Ill tell you. I dont think what you think. I dont think, and I\nnever shall think, that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern\nthinkers. No, sir, Im a democrat, and I still dont believe that Sunday could\nconvert one average navvy or counter-jumper. No, I may be mad, but humanity\nisnt.\n\nSyme turned his bright blue eyes on Bull with an earnestness which he did not\ncommonly make clear.\n\nYou are a very fine fellow, he said. You can believe in a sanity which is\nnot merely your sanity. And youre right enough about humanity, about peasants\nand people like that jolly old innkeeper. But youre not right about Renard. I\nsuspected him from the first. Hes rationalistic, and, whats worse, hes\nrich. When duty and religion are really destroyed, it will be by the rich.\n\nThey are really destroyed now, said the man with a cigarette, and rose with\nhis hands in his pockets. The devils are coming on!\n\nThe men in the motor-car looked anxiously in the direction of his dreamy gaze,\nand they saw that the whole regiment at the end of the road was advancing upon\nthem, Dr. Renard marching furiously in front, his beard flying in the breeze.\n\nThe Colonel sprang out of the car with an intolerant exclamation.\n\nGentlemen, he cried, the thing is incredible. It must be a practical joke.\nIf you knew Renard as I doits like calling Queen Victoria a dynamiter. If\nyou had got the mans character into your head\n\nDr. Bull, said Syme sardonically, has at least got it into his hat.\n\nI tell you it cant be! cried the Colonel, stamping.\n\nRenard shall explain it. He shall explain it to me, and he strode forward.\n\nDont be in such a hurry, drawled the smoker. He will very soon explain it\nto all of us.\n\nBut the impatient Colonel was already out of earshot, advancing towards the\nadvancing enemy. The excited Dr. Renard lifted his pistol again, but\nperceiving his opponent, hesitated, and the Colonel came face to face with him\nwith frantic gestures of remonstrance.\n\nIt is no good, said Syme. He will never get anything out of that old\nheathen. I vote we drive bang through the thick of them, bang as the bullets\nwent through Bulls hat. We may all be killed, but we must kill a tidy number\nof them.\n\nI wont ave it, said Dr. Bull, growing more vulgar in the sincerity of his\nvirtue. The poor chaps may be making a mistake. Give the Colonel a chance.\n\nShall we go back, then? asked the Professor.\n\nNo, said Ratcliffe in a cold voice, the street behind us is held too. In\nfact, I seem to see there another friend of yours, Syme.\n\nSyme spun round smartly, and stared backwards at the track which they had\ntravelled. He saw an irregular body of horsemen gathering and galloping\ntowards them in the gloom. He saw above the foremost saddle the silver gleam\nof a sword, and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old mans hair.\nThe next moment, with shattering violence, he had swung the motor round and\nsent it dashing down the steep side street to the sea, like a man that desired\nonly to die.\n\nWhat the devil is up? cried the Professor, seizing his arm.\n\nThe morning star has fallen! said Syme, as his own car went down the\ndarkness like a falling star.\n\nThe others did not understand his words, but when they looked back at the\nstreet above they saw the hostile cavalry coming round the corner and down the\nslopes after them; and foremost of all rode the good innkeeper, flushed with\nthe fiery innocence of the evening light.\n\nThe world is insane! said the Professor, and buried his face in his hands.\n\nNo, said Dr. Bull in adamantine humility, it is I.\n\nWhat are we going to do? asked the Professor.\n\nAt this moment, said Syme, with a scientific detachment, I think we are\ngoing to smash into a lamppost.\n\nThe next instant the automobile had come with a catastrophic jar against an\niron object. The instant after that four men had crawled out from under a\nchaos of metal, and a tall lean lamp-post that had stood up straight on the\nedge of the marine parade stood out, bent and twisted, like the branch of a\nbroken tree.\n\nWell, we smashed something, said the Professor, with a faint smile. Thats\nsome comfort.\n\nYoure becoming an anarchist, said Syme, dusting his clothes with his\ninstinct of daintiness.\n\nEveryone is, said Ratcliffe.\n\nAs they spoke, the white-haired horseman and his followers came thundering\nfrom above, and almost at the same moment a dark string of men ran shouting\nalong the sea-front. Syme snatched a sword, and took it in his teeth; he stuck\ntwo others under his arm-pits, took a fourth in his left hand and the lantern\nin his right, and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below.\n\nThe others leapt after him, with a common acceptance of such decisive action,\nleaving the debris and the gathering mob above them.\n\nWe have one more chance, said Syme, taking the steel out of his mouth.\nWhatever all this pandemonium means, I suppose the police station will help\nus. We cant get there, for they hold the way. But theres a pier or\nbreakwater runs out into the sea just here, which we could defend longer than\nanything else, like Horatius and his bridge. We must defend it till the\nGendarmerie turn out. Keep after me.\n\nThey followed him as he went crunching down the beach, and in a second or two\ntheir boots broke not on the sea gravel, but on broad, flat stones. They\nmarched down a long, low jetty, running out in one arm into the dim, boiling\nsea, and when they came to the end of it they felt that they had come to the\nend of their story. They turned and faced the town.\n\nThat town was transfigured with uproar. All along the high parade from which\nthey had just descended was a dark and roaring stream of humanity, with\ntossing arms and fiery faces, groping and glaring towards them. The long dark\nline was dotted with torches and lanterns; but even where no flame lit up a\nfurious face, they could see in the farthest figure, in the most shadowy\ngesture, an organised hate. It was clear that they were the accursed of all\nmen, and they knew not why.\n\nTwo or three men, looking little and black like monkeys, leapt over the edge\nas they had done and dropped on to the beach. These came ploughing down the\ndeep sand, shouting horribly, and strove to wade into the sea at random. The\nexample was followed, and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip\nover the edge like black treacle.\n\nForemost among the men on the beach Syme saw the peasant who had driven their\ncart. He splashed into the surf on a huge cart-horse, and shook his axe at\nthem.\n\nThe peasant! cried Syme. They have not risen since the Middle Ages.\n\nEven if the police do come now, said the Professor mournfully, they can do\nnothing with this mob.\n\nNonsense! said Bull desperately; there must be some people left in the town\nwho are human.\n\nNo, said the hopeless Inspector, the human being will soon be extinct. We\nare the last of mankind.\n\nIt may be, said the Professor absently. Then he added in his dreamy voice,\nWhat is all that at the end of the Dunciad?\n\n    \n    \r\n       Nor public flame; nor private, dares to shine;\r\n        Nor human light is left, nor glimpse divine!\r\n        Lo! thy dread Empire, Chaos, is restored;\r\n        Light dies before thine uncreating word:\r\n        Thy hand, great Anarch, lets the curtain fall;\r\n        And universal darkness buries all.\r\n     \n\nStop! cried Bull suddenly, the gendarmes are out.\n\nThe low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with\nhurrying figures, and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of\na disciplined cavalry.\n\nThey are charging the mob! cried Bull in ecstacy or alarm.\n\nNo, said Syme, they are formed along the parade.\n\nThey have unslung their carbines, cried Bull dancing with excitement.\n\nYes, said Ratcliffe, and they are going to fire on us.\n\nAs he spoke there came a long crackle of musketry, and bullets seemed to hop\nlike hailstones on the stones in front of them.\n\nThe gendarmes have joined them! cried the Professor, and struck his\nforehead.\n\nI am in the padded cell, said Bull solidly.\n\nThere was a long silence, and then Ratcliffe said, looking out over the\nswollen sea, all a sort of grey purple\n\nWhat does it matter who is mad or who is sane? We shall all be dead soon.\n\nSyme turned to him and said\n\nYou are quite hopeless, then?\n\nMr. Ratcliffe kept a stony silence; then at last he said quietly\n\nNo; oddly enough I am not quite hopeless. There is one insane little hope\nthat I cannot get out of my mind. The power of this whole planet is against\nus, yet I cannot help wondering whether this one silly little hope is hopeless\nyet.\n\nIn what or whom is your hope? asked Syme with curiosity.\n\nIn a man I never saw, said the other, looking at the leaden sea.\n\nI know what you mean, said Syme in a low voice, the man in the dark room.\nBut Sunday must have killed him by now.\n\nPerhaps, said the other steadily; but if so, he was the only man whom\nSunday found it hard to kill.\n\nI heard what you said, said the Professor, with his back turned. I also am\nholding hard on to the thing I never saw.\n\nAll of a sudden Syme, who was standing as if blind with introspective thought,\nswung round and cried out, like a man waking from sleep\n\nWhere is the Colonel? I thought he was with us!\n\nThe Colonel! Yes, cried Bull, where on earth is the Colonel?\n\nHe went to speak to Renard, said the Professor.\n\nWe cannot leave him among all those beasts, cried Syme. Let us die like\ngentlemen if\n\nDo not pity the Colonel, said Ratcliffe, with a pale sneer. He is extremely\ncomfortable. He is\n\nNo! no! no! cried Syme in a kind of frenzy, not the Colonel too! I will\nnever believe it!\n\nWill you believe your eyes? asked the other, and pointed to the beach.\n\nMany of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their fists, but the\nsea was rough, and they could not reach the pier. Two or three figures,\nhowever, stood on the beginning of the stone footway, and seemed to be\ncautiously advancing down it. The glare of a chance lantern lit up the faces\nof the two foremost. One face wore a black half-mask, and under it the mouth\nwas twisting about in such a madness of nerves that the black tuft of beard\nwriggled round and round like a restless, living thing. The other was the red\nface and white moustache of Colonel Ducroix. They were in earnest\nconsultation.\n\nYes, he is gone too, said the Professor, and sat down on a stone.\nEverythings gone. Im gone! I cant trust my own bodily machinery. I feel as\nif my own hand might fly up and strike me.\n\nWhen my hand flies up, said Syme, it will strike somebody else, and he\nstrode along the pier towards the Colonel, the sword in one hand and the\nlantern in the other.\n\nAs if to destroy the last hope or doubt, the Colonel, who saw him coming,\npointed his revolver at him and fired. The shot missed Syme, but struck his\nsword, breaking it short at the hilt. Syme rushed on, and swung the iron\nlantern above his head.\n\nJudas before Herod! he said, and struck the Colonel down upon the stones.\nThen he turned to the Secretary, whose frightful mouth was almost foaming now,\nand held the lamp high with so rigid and arresting a gesture, that the man\nwas, as it were, frozen for a moment, and forced to hear.\n\nDo you see this lantern? cried Syme in a terrible voice. Do you see the\ncross carved on it, and the flame inside? You did not make it. You did not\nlight it. Better men than you, men who could believe and obey, twisted the\nentrails of iron and preserved the legend of fire. There is not a street you\nwalk on, there is not a thread you wear, that was not made as this lantern\nwas, by denying your philosophy of dirt and rats. You can make nothing. You\ncan only destroy. You will destroy mankind; you will destroy the world. Let\nthat suffice you. Yet this one old Christian lantern you shall not destroy. It\nshall go where your empire of apes will never have the wit to find it.\n\nHe struck the Secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered; and then,\nwhirling it twice round his head, sent it flying far out to sea, where it\nflared like a roaring rocket and fell.\n\nSwords! shouted Syme, turning his flaming face to the three behind him. Let\nus charge these dogs, for our time has come to die.\n\nHis three companions came after him sword in hand. Symes sword was broken,\nbut he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman, flinging him down. In a\nmoment they would have flung themselves upon the face of the mob and perished,\nwhen an interruption came. The Secretary, ever since Symes speech, had stood\nwith his hand to his stricken head as if dazed; now he suddenly pulled off his\nblack mask.\n\nThe pale face thus peeled in the lamplight revealed not so much rage as\nastonishment. He put up his hand with an anxious authority.\n\nThere is some mistake, he said. Mr. Syme, I hardly think you understand\nyour position. I arrest you in the name of the law.\n\nOf the law? said Syme, and dropped his stick.\n\nCertainly! said the Secretary. I am a detective from Scotland Yard, and he\ntook a small blue card from his pocket.\n\nAnd what do you suppose we are? asked the Professor, and threw up his arms.\n\nYou, said the Secretary stiffly, are, as I know for a fact, members of the\nSupreme Anarchist Council. Disguised as one of you, I\n\nDr. Bull tossed his sword into the sea.\n\nThere never was any Supreme Anarchist Council, he said. We were all a lot\nof silly policemen looking at each other. And all these nice people who have\nbeen peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters. I knew I couldnt\nbe wrong about the mob, he said, beaming over the enormous multitude, which\nstretched away to the distance on both sides. Vulgar people are never mad.\nIm vulgar myself, and I know. I am now going on shore to stand a drink to\neverybody here.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER XIII. THE PURSUIT OF THE PRESIDENT\n\nNEXT morning five bewildered but hilarious people took the boat for Dover. The\npoor old Colonel might have had some cause to complain, having been first\nforced to fight for two factions that didnt exist, and then knocked down with\nan iron lantern. But he was a magnanimous old gentleman, and being much\nrelieved that neither party had anything to do with dynamite, he saw them off\non the pier with great geniality.\n\nThe five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to each other.\nThe Secretary had to tell Syme how they had come to wear masks originally in\norder to approach the supposed enemy as fellow-conspirators.\n\nSyme had to explain how they had fled with such swiftness through a civilised\ncountry. But above all these matters of detail which could be explained, rose\nthe central mountain of the matter that they could not explain. What did it\nall mean? If they were all harmless officers, what was Sunday? If he had not\nseized the world, what on earth had he been up to? Inspector Ratcliffe was\nstill gloomy about this.\n\nI cant make head or tail of old Sundays little game any more than you can,\nhe said. But whatever else Sunday is, he isnt a blameless citizen. Damn it!\ndo you remember his face?\n\nI grant you, answered Syme, that I have never been able to forget it.\n\nWell, said the Secretary, I suppose we can find out soon, for tomorrow we\nhave our next general meeting. You will excuse me, he said, with a rather\nghastly smile, for being well acquainted with my secretarial duties.\n\nI suppose you are right, said the Professor reflectively. I suppose we\nmight find it out from him; but I confess that I should feel a bit afraid of\nasking Sunday who he really is.\n\nWhy, asked the Secretary, for fear of bombs?\n\nNo, said the Professor, for fear he might tell me.\n\nLet us have some drinks, said Dr. Bull, after a silence.\n\nThroughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly convivial,\nbut they instinctively kept together. Dr. Bull, who had always been the\noptimist of the party, endeavoured to persuade the other four that the whole\ncompany could take the same hansom cab from Victoria; but this was over-ruled,\nand they went in a four-wheeler, with Dr. Bull on the box, singing. They\nfinished their journey at an hotel in Piccadilly Circus, so as to be close to\nthe early breakfast next morning in Leicester Square. Yet even then the\nadventures of the day were not entirely over. Dr. Bull, discontented with the\ngeneral proposal to go to bed, had strolled out of the hotel at about eleven\nto see and taste some of the beauties of London. Twenty minutes afterwards,\nhowever, he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall. Syme, who tried at\nfirst to soothe him, was forced at last to listen to his communication with\nquite new attention.\n\nI tell you Ive seen him! said Dr. Bull, with thick emphasis.\n\nWhom? asked Syme quickly. Not the President?\n\nNot so bad as that, said Dr. Bull, with unnecessary laughter, not so bad as\nthat. Ive got him here.\n\nGot whom here? asked Syme impatiently.\n\nHairy man, said the other lucidly, man that used to be hairy manGogol.\nHere he is, and he pulled forward by a reluctant elbow the identical young\nman who five days before had marched out of the Council with thin red hair and\na pale face, the first of all the sham anarchists who had been exposed.\n\nWhy do you worry with me? he cried. You have expelled me as a spy.\n\nWe are all spies! whispered Syme.\n\nWere all spies! shouted Dr. Bull. Come and have a drink.\n\nNext morning the battalion of the reunited six marched stolidly towards the\nhotel in Leicester Square.\n\nThis is more cheerful, said Dr. Bull; we are six men going to ask one man\nwhat he means.\n\nI think it is a bit queerer than that, said Syme. I think it is six men\ngoing to ask one man what they mean.\n\nThey turned in silence into the Square, and though the hotel was in the\nopposite corner, they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked\ntoo big for it. He was sitting alone with bent head, poring over a newspaper.\nBut all his councillors, who had come to vote him down, crossed that Square as\nif they were watched out of heaven by a hundred eyes.\n\nThey had disputed much upon their policy, about whether they should leave the\nunmasked Gogol without and begin diplomatically, or whether they should bring\nhim in and blow up the gunpowder at once. The influence of Syme and Bull\nprevailed for the latter course, though the Secretary to the last asked them\nwhy they attacked Sunday so rashly.\n\nMy reason is quite simple, said Syme. I attack him rashly because I am\nafraid of him.\n\nThey followed Syme up the dark stair in silence, and they all came out\nsimultaneously into the broad sunlight of the morning and the broad sunlight\nof Sundays smile.\n\nDelightful! he said. So pleased to see you all. What an exquisite day it\nis. Is the Czar dead?\n\nThe Secretary, who happened to be foremost, drew himself together for a\ndignified outburst.\n\nNo, sir, he said sternly there has been no massacre. I bring you news of no\nsuch disgusting spectacles.\n\nDisgusting spectacles? repeated the President, with a bright, inquiring\nsmile. You mean Dr. Bulls spectacles?\n\nThe Secretary choked for a moment, and the President went on with a sort of\nsmooth appeal\n\nOf course, we all have our opinions and even our eyes, but really to call\nthem disgusting before the man himself\n\nDr. Bull tore off his spectacles and broke them on the table.\n\nMy spectacles are blackguardly, he said, but Im not. Look at my face.\n\nI dare say its the sort of face that grows on one, said the President, in\nfact, it grows on you; and who am I to quarrel with the wild fruits upon the\nTree of Life? I dare say it will grow on me some day.\n\nWe have no time for tomfoolery, said the Secretary, breaking in savagely.\nWe have come to know what all this means. Who are you? What are you? Why did\nyou get us all here? Do you know who and what we are? Are you a half-witted\nman playing the conspirator, or are you a clever man playing the fool? Answer\nme, I tell you.\n\nCandidates, murmured Sunday, are only required to answer eight out of the\nseventeen questions on the paper. As far as I can make out, you want me to\ntell you what I am, and what you are, and what this table is, and what this\nCouncil is, and what this world is for all I know. Well, I will go so far as\nto rend the veil of one mystery. If you want to know what you are, you are a\nset of highly well-intentioned young jackasses.\n\nAnd you, said Syme, leaning forward, what are you?\n\nI? What am I? roared the President, and he rose slowly to an incredible\nheight, like some enormous wave about to arch above them and break. You want\nto know what I am, do you? Bull, you are a man of science. Grub in the roots\nof those trees and find out the truth about them. Syme, you are a poet. Stare\nat those morning clouds. But I tell you this, that you will have found out the\ntruth of the last tree and the top-most cloud before the truth about me. You\nwill understand the sea, and I shall be still a riddle; you shall know what\nthe stars are, and not know what I am. Since the beginning of the world all\nmen have hunted me like a wolfkings and sages, and poets and lawgivers, all\nthe churches, and all the philosophies. But I have never been caught yet, and\nthe skies will fall in the time I turn to bay. I have given them a good run\nfor their money, and I will now.\n\nBefore one of them could move, the monstrous man had swung himself like some\nhuge ourang-outang over the balustrade of the balcony. Yet before he dropped\nhe pulled himself up again as on a horizontal bar, and thrusting his great\nchin over the edge of the balcony, said solemnly\n\nTheres one thing Ill tell you though about who I am. I am the man in the\ndark room, who made you all policemen.\n\nWith that he fell from the balcony, bouncing on the stones below like a great\nball of india-rubber, and went bounding off towards the corner of the\nAlhambra, where he hailed a hansom-cab and sprang inside it. The six\ndetectives had been standing thunderstruck and livid in the light of his last\nassertion; but when he disappeared into the cab, Symes practical senses\nreturned to him, and leaping over the balcony so recklessly as almost to break\nhis legs, he called another cab.\n\nHe and Bull sprang into the cab together, the Professor and the Inspector into\nanother, while the Secretary and the late Gogol scrambled into a third just in\ntime to pursue the flying Syme, who was pursuing the flying President. Sunday\nled them a wild chase towards the north-west, his cabman, evidently under the\ninfluence of more than common inducements, urging the horse at breakneck\nspeed. But Syme was in no mood for delicacies, and he stood up in his own cab\nshouting, Stop thief! until crowds ran along beside his cab, and policemen\nbegan to stop and ask questions. All this had its influence upon the\nPresidents cabman, who began to look dubious, and to slow down to a trot. He\nopened the trap to talk reasonably to his fare, and in so doing let the long\nwhip droop over the front of the cab. Sunday leant forward, seized it, and\njerked it violently out of the mans hand. Then standing up in front of the\ncab himself, he lashed the horse and roared aloud, so that they went down the\nstreets like a flying storm. Through street after street and square after\nsquare went whirling this preposterous vehicle, in which the fare was urging\nthe horse and the driver trying desperately to stop it. The other three cabs\ncame after it (if the phrase be permissible of a cab) like panting hounds.\nShops and streets shot by like rattling arrows.\n\nAt the highest ecstacy of speed, Sunday turned round on the splashboard where\nhe stood, and sticking his great grinning head out of the cab, with white hair\nwhistling in the wind, he made a horrible face at his pursuers, like some\ncolossal urchin. Then raising his right hand swiftly, he flung a ball of paper\nin Symes face and vanished. Syme caught the thing while instinctively warding\nit off, and discovered that it consisted of two crumpled papers. One was\naddressed to himself, and the other to Dr. Bull, with a very long, and it is\nto be feared partly ironical, string of letters after his name. Dr. Bulls\naddress was, at any rate, considerably longer than his communication, for the\ncommunication consisted entirely of the words:\n\nWhat about Martin Tupper now?\n\nWhat does the old maniac mean? asked Bull, staring at the words. What does\nyours say, Syme?\n\nSymes message was, at any rate, longer, and ran as follows:\n\nNo one would regret anything in the nature of an interference by the\nArchdeacon more than I. I trust it will not come to that. But, for the last\ntime, where are your goloshes? The thing is too bad, especially after what\nuncle said.\n\nThe Presidents cabman seemed to be regaining some control over his horse, and\nthe pursuers gained a little as they swept round into the Edgware Road. And\nhere there occurred what seemed to the allies a providential stoppage. Traffic\nof every kind was swerving to right or left or stopping, for down the long\nroad was coming the unmistakable roar announcing the fire-engine, which in a\nfew seconds went by like a brazen thunderbolt. But quick as it went by, Sunday\nhad bounded out of his cab, sprung at the fire-engine, caught it, slung\nhimself on to it, and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking\nto the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures.\n\nAfter him! howled Syme. He cant go astray now. Theres no mistaking a\nfire-engine.\n\nThe three cabmen, who had been stunned for a moment, whipped up their horses\nand slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing\nprey. The President acknowledged this proximity by coming to the back of the\ncar, bowing repeatedly, kissing his hand, and finally flinging a neatly-folded\nnote into the bosom of Inspector Ratcliffe. When that gentleman opened it, not\nwithout impatience, he found it contained the words:\n\n    \n    \r\n       Fly at once. The truth about your trouser-stretchers is known.\r\n       A FRIEND.\r\n     \n\nThe fire-engine had struck still farther to the north, into a region that they\ndid not recognise; and as it ran by a line of high railings shadowed with\ntrees, the six friends were startled, but somewhat relieved, to see the\nPresident leap from the fire-engine, though whether through another whim or\nthe increasing protest of his entertainers they could not see. Before the\nthree cabs, however, could reach up to the spot, he had gone up the high\nrailings like a huge grey cat, tossed himself over, and vanished in a darkness\nof leaves.\n\nSyme with a furious gesture stopped his cab, jumped out, and sprang also to\nthe escalade. When he had one leg over the fence and his friends were\nfollowing, he turned a face on them which shone quite pale in the shadow.\n\nWhat place can this be? he asked. Can it be the old devils house? Ive\nheard he has a house in North London.\n\nAll the better, said the Secretary grimly, planting a foot in a foothold,\nwe shall find him at home.\n\nNo, but it isnt that, said Syme, knitting his brows. I hear the most\nhorrible noises, like devils laughing and sneezing and blowing their devilish\nnoses!\n\nHis dogs barking, of course, said the Secretary.\n\nWhy not say his black-beetles barking! said Syme furiously, snails barking!\ngeraniums barking! Did you ever hear a dog bark like that?\n\nHe held up his hand, and there came out of the thicket a long growling roar\nthat seemed to get under the skin and freeze the flesha low thrilling roar\nthat made a throbbing in the air all about them.\n\nThe dogs of Sunday would be no ordinary dogs, said Gogol, and shuddered.\n\nSyme had jumped down on the other side, but he still stood listening\nimpatiently.\n\nWell, listen to that, he said, is that a doganybodys dog?\n\nThere broke upon their ear a hoarse screaming as of things protesting and\nclamouring in sudden pain; and then, far off like an echo, what sounded like a\nlong nasal trumpet.\n\nWell, his house ought to be hell! said the Secretary; and if it is hell,\nIm going in! and he sprang over the tall railings almost with one swing.\n\nThe others followed. They broke through a tangle of plants and shrubs, and\ncame out on an open path. Nothing was in sight, but Dr. Bull suddenly struck\nhis hands together.\n\nWhy, you asses, he cried, its the Zoo!\n\nAs they were looking round wildly for any trace of their wild quarry, a keeper\nin uniform came running along the path with a man in plain clothes.\n\nHas it come this way? gasped the keeper.\n\nHas what? asked Syme.\n\nThe elephant! cried the keeper. An elephant has gone mad and run away!\n\nHe has run away with an old gentleman, said the other stranger breathlessly,\na poor old gentleman with white hair!\n\nWhat sort of old gentleman? asked Syme, with great curiosity.\n\nA very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes, said the keeper\neagerly.\n\nWell, said Syme, if hes that particular kind of old gentleman, if youre\nquite sure that hes a large and fat old gentleman in grey clothes, you may\ntake my word for it that the elephant has not run away with him. He has run\naway with the elephant. The elephant is not made by God that could run away\nwith him if he did not consent to the elopement. And, by thunder, there he\nis!\n\nThere was no doubt about it this time. Clean across the space of grass, about\ntwo hundred yards away, with a crowd screaming and scampering vainly at his\nheels, went a huge grey elephant at an awful stride, with his trunk thrown out\nas rigid as a ships bowsprit, and trumpeting like the trumpet of doom. On the\nback of the bellowing and plunging animal sat President Sunday with all the\nplacidity of a sultan, but goading the animal to a furious speed with some\nsharp object in his hand.\n\nStop him! screamed the populace. Hell be out of the gate!\n\nStop a landslide! said the keeper. He is out of the gate!\n\nAnd even as he spoke, a final crash and roar of terror announced that the\ngreat grey elephant had broken out of the gates of the Zoological Gardens, and\nwas careening down Albany Street like a new and swift sort of omnibus.\n\nGreat Lord! cried Bull, I never knew an elephant could go so fast. Well, it\nmust be hansom-cabs again if we are to keep him in sight.\n\nAs they raced along to the gate out of which the elephant had vanished, Syme\nfelt a glaring panorama of the strange animals in the cages which they passed.\nAfterwards he thought it queer that he should have seen them so clearly. He\nremembered especially seeing pelicans, with their preposterous, pendant\nthroats. He wondered why the pelican was the symbol of charity, except it was\nthat it wanted a good deal of charity to admire a pelican. He remembered a\nhornbill, which was simply a huge yellow beak with a small bird tied on behind\nit. The whole gave him a sensation, the vividness of which he could not\nexplain, that Nature was always making quite mysterious jokes. Sunday had told\nthem that they would understand him when they had understood the stars. He\nwondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill.\n\nThe six unhappy detectives flung themselves into cabs and followed the\nelephant sharing the terror which he spread through the long stretch of the\nstreets. This time Sunday did not turn round, but offered them the solid\nstretch of his unconscious back, which maddened them, if possible, more than\nhis previous mockeries. Just before they came to Baker Street, however, he was\nseen to throw something far up into the air, as a boy does a ball meaning to\ncatch it again. But at their rate of racing it fell far behind, just by the\ncab containing Gogol; and in faint hope of a clue or for some impulse\nunexplainable, he stopped his cab so as to pick it up. It was addressed to\nhimself, and was quite a bulky parcel. On examination, however, its bulk was\nfound to consist of thirty-three pieces of paper of no value wrapped one round\nthe other. When the last covering was torn away it reduced itself to a small\nslip of paper, on which was written:\n\nThe word, I fancy, should be pink.\n\nThe man once known as Gogol said nothing, but the movements of his hands and\nfeet were like those of a man urging a horse to renewed efforts.\n\nThrough street after street, through district after district, went the prodigy\nof the flying elephant, calling crowds to every window, and driving the\ntraffic left and right. And still through all this insane publicity the three\ncabs toiled after it, until they came to be regarded as part of a procession,\nand perhaps the advertisement of a circus. They went at such a rate that\ndistances were shortened beyond belief, and Syme saw the Albert Hall in\nKensington when he thought that he was still in Paddington. The animals pace\nwas even more fast and free through the empty, aristocratic streets of South\nKensington, and he finally headed towards that part of the sky-line where the\nenormous Wheel of Earls Court stood up in the sky. The wheel grew larger and\nlarger, till it filled heaven like the wheel of stars.\n\nThe beast outstripped the cabs. They lost him round several corners, and when\nthey came to one of the gates of the Earls Court Exhibition they found\nthemselves finally blocked. In front of them was an enormous crowd; in the\nmidst of it was an enormous elephant, heaving and shuddering as such shapeless\ncreatures do. But the President had disappeared.\n\nWhere has he gone to? asked Syme, slipping to the ground.\n\nGentleman rushed into the Exhibition, sir! said an official in a dazed\nmanner. Then he added in an injured voice: Funny gentleman, sir. Asked me to\nhold his horse, and gave me this.\n\nHe held out with distaste a piece of folded paper, addressed: To the\nSecretary of the Central Anarchist Council.\n\nThe Secretary, raging, rent it open, and found written inside it:\n\n    \n    \r\n       When the herring runs a mile,\r\n        Let the Secretary smile;\r\n        When the herring tries to fly,\r\n        Let the Secretary die.\r\n                        Rustic Proverb.\r\n     \n\nWhy the eternal crikey, began the Secretary, did you let the man in? Do\npeople commonly come to your Exhibition riding on mad elephants? Do\n\nLook! shouted Syme suddenly. Look over there!\n\nLook at what? asked the Secretary savagely.\n\nLook at the captive balloon! said Syme, and pointed in a frenzy.\n\nWhy the blazes should I look at a captive balloon? demanded the Secretary.\nWhat is there queer about a captive balloon?\n\nNothing, said Syme, except that it isnt captive!\n\nThey all turned their eyes to where the balloon swung and swelled above the\nExhibition on a string, like a childs balloon. A second afterwards the string\ncame in two just under the car, and the balloon, broken loose, floated away\nwith the freedom of a soap bubble.\n\nTen thousand devils! shrieked the Secretary. Hes got into it! and he\nshook his fists at the sky.\n\nThe balloon, borne by some chance wind, came right above them, and they could\nsee the great white head of the President peering over the side and looking\nbenevolently down on them.\n\nGod bless my soul! said the Professor with the elderly manner that he could\nnever disconnect from his bleached beard and parchment face. God bless my\nsoul! I seemed to fancy that something fell on the top of my hat!\n\nHe put up a trembling hand and took from that shelf a piece of twisted paper,\nwhich he opened absently only to find it inscribed with a true lovers knot\nand, the words:\n\nYour beauty has not left me indifferent.From LITTLE SNOWDROP.\n\nThere was a short silence, and then Syme said, biting his beard\n\nIm not beaten yet. The blasted thing must come down somewhere. Lets follow\nit!\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER XIV. THE SIX PHILOSOPHERS\n\nACROSS green fields, and breaking through blooming hedges, toiled six draggled\ndetectives, about five miles out of London. The optimist of the party had at\nfirst proposed that they should follow the balloon across South England in\nhansom-cabs. But he was ultimately convinced of the persistent refusal of the\nballoon to follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the\ncabmen to follow the balloon. Consequently the tireless though exasperated\ntravellers broke through black thickets and ploughed through ploughed fields\ntill each was turned into a figure too outrageous to be mistaken for a tramp.\nThose green hills of Surrey saw the final collapse and tragedy of the\nadmirable light grey suit in which Syme had set out from Saffron Park. His\nsilk hat was broken over his nose by a swinging bough, his coat-tails were\ntorn to the shoulder by arresting thorns, the clay of England was splashed up\nto his collar; but he still carried his yellow beard forward with a silent and\nfurious determination, and his eyes were still fixed on that floating ball of\ngas, which in the full flush of sunset seemed coloured like a sunset cloud.\n\nAfter all, he said, it is very beautiful!\n\nIt is singularly and strangely beautiful! said the Professor. I wish the\nbeastly gas-bag would burst!\n\nNo, said Dr. Bull, I hope it wont. It might hurt the old boy.\n\nHurt him! said the vindictive Professor, hurt him! Not as much as Id hurt\nhim if I could get up with him. Little Snowdrop!\n\nI dont want him hurt, somehow, said Dr. Bull.\n\nWhat! cried the Secretary bitterly. Do you believe all that tale about his\nbeing our man in the dark room? Sunday would say he was anybody.\n\nI dont know whether I believe it or not, said Dr. Bull. But it isnt that\nthat I mean. I cant wish old Sundays balloon to burst because\n\nWell, said Syme impatiently, because?\n\nWell, because hes so jolly like a balloon himself, said Dr. Bull\ndesperately. I dont understand a word of all that idea of his being the same\nman who gave us all our blue cards. It seems to make everything nonsense. But\nI dont care who knows it, I always had a sympathy for old Sunday himself,\nwicked as he was. Just as if he was a great bouncing baby. How can I explain\nwhat my queer sympathy was? It didnt prevent my fighting him like hell! Shall\nI make it clear if I say that I liked him because he was so fat?\n\nYou will not, said the Secretary.\n\nIve got it now, cried Bull, it was because he was so fat and so light.\nJust like a balloon. We always think of fat people as heavy, but he could have\ndanced against a sylph. I see now what I mean. Moderate strength is shown in\nviolence, supreme strength is shown in levity. It was like the old\nspeculationswhat would happen if an elephant could leap up in the sky like a\ngrasshopper?\n\nOur elephant, said Syme, looking upwards, has leapt into the sky like a\ngrasshopper.\n\nAnd somehow, concluded Bull, thats why I cant help liking old Sunday. No,\nits not an admiration of force, or any silly thing like that. There is a kind\nof gaiety in the thing, as if he were bursting with some good news. Havent\nyou sometimes felt it on a spring day? You know Nature plays tricks, but\nsomehow that day proves they are good-natured tricks. I never read the Bible\nmyself, but that part they laugh at is literal truth, Why leap ye, ye high\nhills? The hills do leapat least, they try to.... Why do I like Sunday?...\nhow can I tell you?... because hes such a Bounder.\n\nThere was a long silence, and then the Secretary said in a curious, strained\nvoice\n\nYou do not know Sunday at all. Perhaps it is because you are better than I,\nand do not know hell. I was a fierce fellow, and a trifle morbid from the\nfirst. The man who sits in darkness, and who chose us all, chose me because I\nhad all the crazy look of a conspiratorbecause my smile went crooked, and my\neyes were gloomy, even when I smiled. But there must have been something in me\nthat answered to the nerves in all these anarchic men. For when I first saw\nSunday he expressed to me, not your airy vitality, but something both gross\nand sad in the Nature of Things. I found him smoking in a twilight room, a\nroom with brown blind down, infinitely more depressing than the genial\ndarkness in which our master lives. He sat there on a bench, a huge heap of a\nman, dark and out of shape. He listened to all my words without speaking or\neven stirring. I poured out my most passionate appeals, and asked my most\neloquent questions. Then, after a long silence, the Thing began to shake, and\nI thought it was shaken by some secret malady. It shook like a loathsome and\nliving jelly. It reminded me of everything I had ever read about the base\nbodies that are the origin of lifethe deep sea lumps and protoplasm. It\nseemed like the final form of matter, the most shapeless and the most\nshameful. I could only tell myself, from its shudderings, that it was\nsomething at least that such a monster could be miserable. And then it broke\nupon me that the bestial mountain was shaking with a lonely laughter, and the\nlaughter was at me. Do you ask me to forgive him that? It is no small thing to\nbe laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself.\n\nSurely you fellows are exaggerating wildly, cut in the clear voice of\nInspector Ratcliffe. President Sunday is a terrible fellow for ones\nintellect, but he is not such a Barnums freak physically as you make out. He\nreceived me in an ordinary office, in a grey check coat, in broad daylight. He\ntalked to me in an ordinary way. But Ill tell you what is a trifle creepy\nabout Sunday. His room is neat, his clothes are neat, everything seems in\norder; but hes absent-minded. Sometimes his great bright eyes go quite blind.\nFor hours he forgets that you are there. Now absent-mindedness is just a bit\ntoo awful in a bad man. We think of a wicked man as vigilant. We cant think\nof a wicked man who is honestly and sincerely dreamy, because we darent think\nof a wicked man alone with himself. An absentminded man means a good-natured\nman. It means a man who, if he happens to see you, will apologise. But how\nwill you bear an absentminded man who, if he happens to see you, will kill\nyou? That is what tries the nerves, abstraction combined with cruelty. Men\nhave felt it sometimes when they went through wild forests, and felt that the\nanimals there were at once innocent and pitiless. They might ignore or slay.\nHow would you like to pass ten mortal hours in a parlour with an absent-minded\ntiger?\n\nAnd what do you think of Sunday, Gogol? asked Syme.\n\nI dont think of Sunday on principle, said Gogol simply, any more than I\nstare at the sun at noonday.\n\nWell, that is a point of view, said Syme thoughtfully. What do you say,\nProfessor?\n\nThe Professor was walking with bent head and trailing stick, and he did not\nanswer at all.\n\nWake up, Professor! said Syme genially. Tell us what you think of Sunday.\n\nThe Professor spoke at last very slowly.\n\nI think something, he said, that I cannot say clearly. Or, rather, I think\nsomething that I cannot even think clearly. But it is something like this. My\nearly life, as you know, was a bit too large and loose.\n\nWell, when I saw Sundays face I thought it was too largeeverybody does, but\nI also thought it was too loose. The face was so big, that one couldnt focus\nit or make it a face at all. The eye was so far away from the nose, that it\nwasnt an eye. The mouth was so much by itself, that one had to think of it by\nitself. The whole thing is too hard to explain.\n\nHe paused for a little, still trailing his stick, and then went on\n\nBut put it this way. Walking up a road at night, I have seen a lamp and a\nlighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable\nface. If anyone in heaven has that face I shall know him again. Yet when I\nwalked a little farther I found that there was no face, that the window was\nten yards away, the lamp ten hundred yards, the cloud beyond the world. Well,\nSundays face escaped me; it ran away to right and left, as such chance\npictures run away. And so his face has made me, somehow, doubt whether there\nare any faces. I dont know whether your face, Bull, is a face or a\ncombination in perspective. Perhaps one black disc of your beastly glasses is\nquite close and another fifty miles away. Oh, the doubts of a materialist are\nnot worth a dump. Sunday has taught me the last and the worst doubts, the\ndoubts of a spiritualist. I am a Buddhist, I suppose; and Buddhism is not a\ncreed, it is a doubt. My poor dear Bull, I do not believe that you really have\na face. I have not faith enough to believe in matter.\n\nSymes eyes were still fixed upon the errant orb, which, reddened in the\nevening light, looked like some rosier and more innocent world.\n\nHave you noticed an odd thing, he said, about all your descriptions? Each\nman of you finds Sunday quite different, yet each man of you can only find one\nthing to compare him tothe universe itself. Bull finds him like the earth in\nspring, Gogol like the sun at noonday. The Secretary is reminded of the\nshapeless protoplasm, and the Inspector of the carelessness of virgin forests.\nThe Professor says he is like a changing landscape. This is queer, but it is\nqueerer still that I also have had my odd notion about the President, and I\nalso find that I think of Sunday as I think of the whole world.\n\nGet on a little faster, Syme, said Bull; never mind the balloon.\n\nWhen I first saw Sunday, said Syme slowly, I only saw his back; and when I\nsaw his back, I knew he was the worst man in the world. His neck and shoulders\nwere brutal, like those of some apish god. His head had a stoop that was\nhardly human, like the stoop of an ox. In fact, I had at once the revolting\nfancy that this was not a man at all, but a beast dressed up in mens\nclothes.\n\nGet on, said Dr. Bull.\n\nAnd then the queer thing happened. I had seen his back from the street, as he\nsat in the balcony. Then I entered the hotel, and coming round the other side\nof him, saw his face in the sunlight. His face frightened me, as it did\neveryone; but not because it was brutal, not because it was evil. On the\ncontrary, it frightened me because it was so beautiful, because it was so\ngood.\n\nSyme, exclaimed the Secretary, are you ill?\n\nIt was like the face of some ancient archangel, judging justly after heroic\nwars. There was laughter in the eyes, and in the mouth honour and sorrow.\nThere was the same white hair, the same great, grey-clad shoulders that I had\nseen from behind. But when I saw him from behind I was certain he was an\nanimal, and when I saw him in front I knew he was a god.\n\nPan, said the Professor dreamily, was a god and an animal.\n\nThen, and again and always, went on Syme like a man talking to himself,\nthat has been for me the mystery of Sunday, and it is also the mystery of the\nworld. When I see the horrible back, I am sure the noble face is but a mask.\nWhen I see the face but for an instant, I know the back is only a jest. Bad is\nso bad, that we cannot but think good an accident; good is so good, that we\nfeel certain that evil could be explained. But the whole came to a kind of\ncrest yesterday when I raced Sunday for the cab, and was just behind him all\nthe way.\n\nHad you time for thinking then? asked Ratcliffe.\n\nTime, replied Syme, for one outrageous thought. I was suddenly possessed\nwith the idea that the blind, blank back of his head really was his facean\nawful, eyeless face staring at me! And I fancied that the figure running in\nfront of me was really a figure running backwards, and dancing as he ran.\n\nHorrible! said Dr. Bull, and shuddered.\n\nHorrible is not the word, said Syme. It was exactly the worst instant of my\nlife. And yet ten minutes afterwards, when he put his head out of the cab and\nmade a grimace like a gargoyle, I knew that he was only like a father playing\nhide-and-seek with his children.\n\nIt is a long game, said the Secretary, and frowned at his broken boots.\n\nListen to me, cried Syme with extraordinary emphasis. Shall I tell you the\nsecret of the whole world? It is that we have only known the back of the\nworld. We see everything from behind, and it looks brutal. That is not a tree,\nbut the back of a tree. That is not a cloud, but the back of a cloud. Cannot\nyou see that everything is stooping and hiding a face? If we could only get\nround in front\n\nLook! cried out Bull clamorously, the balloon is coming down!\n\nThere was no need to cry out to Syme, who had never taken his eyes off it. He\nsaw the great luminous globe suddenly stagger in the sky, right itself, and\nthen sink slowly behind the trees like a setting sun.\n\nThe man called Gogol, who had hardly spoken through all their weary travels,\nsuddenly threw up his hands like a lost spirit.\n\nHe is dead! he cried. And now I know he was my friendmy friend in the\ndark!\n\nDead! snorted the Secretary. You will not find him dead easily. If he has\nbeen tipped out of the car, we shall find him rolling as a colt rolls in a\nfield, kicking his legs for fun.\n\nClashing his hoofs, said the Professor. The colts do, and so did Pan.\n\nPan again! said Dr. Bull irritably. You seem to think Pan is everything.\n\nSo he is, said the Professor, in Greek. He means everything.\n\nDont forget, said the Secretary, looking down, that he also means Panic.\n\nSyme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations.\n\nIt fell over there, he said shortly. Let us follow it!\n\nThen he added with an indescribable gesture\n\nOh, if he has cheated us all by getting killed! It would be like one of his\nlarks.\n\nHe strode off towards the distant trees with a new energy, his rags and\nribbons fluttering in the wind. The others followed him in a more footsore and\ndubious manner. And almost at the same moment all six men realised that they\nwere not alone in the little field.\n\nAcross the square of turf a tall man was advancing towards them, leaning on a\nstrange long staff like a sceptre. He was clad in a fine but old-fashioned\nsuit with knee-breeches; its colour was that shade between blue, violet and\ngrey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland. His hair was\nwhitish grey, and at the first glance, taken along with his knee-breeches,\nlooked as if it was powdered. His advance was very quiet; but for the silver\nfrost upon his head, he might have been one to the shadows of the wood.\n\nGentlemen, he said, my master has a carriage waiting for you in the road\njust by.\n\nWho is your master? asked Syme, standing quite still.\n\nI was told you knew his name, said the man respectfully.\n\nThere was a silence, and then the Secretary said\n\nWhere is this carriage?\n\nIt has been waiting only a few moments, said the stranger. My master has\nonly just come home.\n\nSyme looked left and right upon the patch of green field in which he found\nhimself. The hedges were ordinary hedges, the trees seemed ordinary trees; yet\nhe felt like a man entrapped in fairyland.\n\nHe looked the mysterious ambassador up and down, but he could discover nothing\nexcept that the mans coat was the exact colour of the purple shadows, and\nthat the mans face was the exact colour of the red and brown and golden sky.\n\nShow us the place, Syme said briefly, and without a word the man in the\nviolet coat turned his back and walked towards a gap in the hedge, which let\nin suddenly the light of a white road.\n\nAs the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare, they saw the white road\nblocked by what looked like a long row of carriages, such a row of carriages\nas might close the approach to some house in Park Lane. Along the side of\nthese carriages stood a rank of splendid servants, all dressed in the grey-\nblue uniform, and all having a certain quality of stateliness and freedom\nwhich would not commonly belong to the servants of a gentleman, but rather to\nthe officials and ambassadors of a great king. There were no less than six\ncarriages waiting, one for each of the tattered and miserable band. All the\nattendants (as if in court-dress) wore swords, and as each man crawled into\nhis carriage they drew them, and saluted with a sudden blaze of steel.\n\nWhat can it all mean? asked Bull of Syme as they separated. Is this another\njoke of Sundays?\n\nI dont know, said Syme as he sank wearily back in the cushions of his\ncarriage; but if it is, its one of the jokes you talk about. Its a good-\nnatured one.\n\nThe six adventurers had passed through many adventures, but not one had\ncarried them so utterly off their feet as this last adventure of comfort. They\nhad all become inured to things going roughly; but things suddenly going\nsmoothly swamped them. They could not even feebly imagine what the carriages\nwere; it was enough for them to know that they were carriages, and carriages\nwith cushions. They could not conceive who the old man was who had led them;\nbut it was quite enough that he had certainly led them to the carriages.\n\nSyme drove through a drifting darkness of trees in utter abandonment. It was\ntypical of him that while he had carried his bearded chin forward fiercely so\nlong as anything could be done, when the whole business was taken out of his\nhands he fell back on the cushions in a frank collapse.\n\nVery gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage\nwas carrying him. He saw that they passed the stone gates of what might have\nbeen a park, that they began gradually to climb a hill which, while wooded on\nboth sides, was somewhat more orderly than a forest. Then there began to grow\nupon him, as upon a man slowly waking from a healthy sleep, a pleasure in\neverything. He felt that the hedges were what hedges should be, living walls;\nthat a hedge is like a human army, disciplined, but all the more alive. He saw\nhigh elms behind the hedges, and vaguely thought how happy boys would be\nclimbing there. Then his carriage took a turn of the path, and he saw suddenly\nand quietly, like a long, low, sunset cloud, a long, low house, mellow in the\nmild light of sunset. All the six friends compared notes afterwards and\nquarrelled; but they all agreed that in some unaccountable way the place\nreminded them of their boyhood. It was either this elm-top or that crooked\npath, it was either this scrap of orchard or that shape of a window; but each\nman of them declared that he could remember this place before he could\nremember his mother.\n\nWhen the carriages eventually rolled up to a large, low, cavernous gateway,\nanother man in the same uniform, but wearing a silver star on the grey breast\nof his coat, came out to meet them. This impressive person said to the\nbewildered Syme\n\nRefreshments are provided for you in your room.\n\nSyme, under the influence of the same mesmeric sleep of amazement, went up the\nlarge oaken stairs after the respectful attendant. He entered a splendid suite\nof apartments that seemed to be designed specially for him. He walked up to a\nlong mirror with the ordinary instinct of his class, to pull his tie straight\nor to smooth his hair; and there he saw the frightful figure that he wasblood\nrunning down his face from where the bough had struck him, his hair standing\nout like yellow rags of rank grass, his clothes torn into long, wavering\ntatters. At once the whole enigma sprang up, simply as the question of how he\nhad got there, and how he was to get out again. Exactly at the same moment a\nman in blue, who had been appointed as his valet, said very solemnly\n\nI have put out your clothes, sir.\n\nClothes! said Syme sardonically. I have no clothes except these, and he\nlifted two long strips of his frock-coat in fascinating festoons, and made a\nmovement as if to twirl like a ballet girl.\n\nMy master asks me to say, said the attendant, that there is a fancy dress\nball tonight, and that he desires you to put on the costume that I have laid\nout. Meanwhile, sir, there is a bottle of Burgundy and some cold pheasant,\nwhich he hopes you will not refuse, as it is some hours before supper.\n\nCold pheasant is a good thing, said Syme reflectively, and Burgundy is a\nspanking good thing. But really I do not want either of them so much as I want\nto know what the devil all this means, and what sort of costume you have got\nlaid out for me. Where is it?\n\nThe servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock-blue drapery, rather\nof the nature of a domino, on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden\nsun, and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents.\n\nYoure to be dressed as Thursday, sir, said the valet somewhat affably.\n\nDressed as Thursday! said Syme in meditation. It doesnt sound a warm\ncostume.\n\nOh, yes, sir, said the other eagerly, the Thursday costume is quite warm,\nsir. It fastens up to the chin.\n\nWell, I dont understand anything, said Syme, sighing. I have been used so\nlong to uncomfortable adventures that comfortable adventures knock me out.\nStill, I may be allowed to ask why I should be particularly like Thursday in a\ngreen frock spotted all over with the sun and moon. Those orbs, I think, shine\non other days. I once saw the moon on Tuesday, I remember.\n\nBeg pardon, sir, said the valet, Bible also provided for you, and with a\nrespectful and rigid finger he pointed out a passage in the first chapter of\nGenesis. Syme read it wondering. It was that in which the fourth day of the\nweek is associated with the creation of the sun and moon. Here, however, they\nreckoned from a Christian Sunday.\n\nThis is getting wilder and wilder, said Syme, as he sat down in a chair.\nWho are these people who provide cold pheasant and Burgundy, and green\nclothes and Bibles? Do they provide everything?\n\nYes, sir, everything, said the attendant gravely. Shall I help you on with\nyour costume?\n\nOh, hitch the bally thing on! said Syme impatiently.\n\nBut though he affected to despise the mummery, he felt a curious freedom and\nnaturalness in his movements as the blue and gold garment fell about him; and\nwhen he found that he had to wear a sword, it stirred a boyish dream. As he\npassed out of the room he flung the folds across his shoulder with a gesture,\nhis sword stood out at an angle, and he had all the swagger of a troubadour.\nFor these disguises did not disguise, but reveal.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER XV. THE ACCUSER\n\nAS Syme strode along the corridor he saw the Secretary standing at the top of\na great flight of stairs. The man had never looked so noble. He was draped in\na long robe of starless black, down the centre of which fell a band or broad\nstripe of pure white, like a single shaft of light. The whole looked like some\nvery severe ecclesiastical vestment. There was no need for Syme to search his\nmemory or the Bible in order to remember that the first day of creation marked\nthe mere creation of light out of darkness. The vestment itself would alone\nhave suggested the symbol; and Syme felt also how perfectly this pattern of\npure white and black expressed the soul of the pale and austere Secretary,\nwith his inhuman veracity and his cold frenzy, which made him so easily make\nwar on the anarchists, and yet so easily pass for one of them. Syme was\nscarcely surprised to notice that, amid all the ease and hospitality of their\nnew surroundings, this mans eyes were still stern. No smell of ale or\norchards could make the Secretary cease to ask a reasonable question.\n\nIf Syme had been able to see himself, he would have realised that he, too,\nseemed to be for the first time himself and no one else. For if the Secretary\nstood for that philosopher who loves the original and formless light, Syme was\na type of the poet who seeks always to make the light in special shapes, to\nsplit it up into sun and star. The philosopher may sometimes love the\ninfinite; the poet always loves the finite. For him the great moment is not\nthe creation of light, but the creation of the sun and moon.\n\nAs they descended the broad stairs together they overtook Ratcliffe, who was\nclad in spring green like a huntsman, and the pattern upon whose garment was a\ngreen tangle of trees. For he stood for that third day on which the earth and\ngreen things were made, and his square, sensible face, with its not unfriendly\ncynicism, seemed appropriate enough to it.\n\nThey were led out of another broad and low gateway into a very large old\nEnglish garden, full of torches and bonfires, by the broken light of which a\nvast carnival of people were dancing in motley dress. Syme seemed to see every\nshape in Nature imitated in some crazy costume. There was a man dressed as a\nwindmill with enormous sails, a man dressed as an elephant, a man dressed as a\nballoon; the two last, together, seemed to keep the thread of their farcical\nadventures. Syme even saw, with a queer thrill, one dancer dressed like an\nenormous hornbill, with a beak twice as big as himselfthe queer bird which\nhad fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down\nthe long road at the Zoological Gardens. There were a thousand other such\nobjects, however. There was a dancing lamp-post, a dancing apple tree, a\ndancing ship. One would have thought that the untamable tune of some mad\nmusician had set all the common objects of field and street dancing an eternal\njig. And long afterwards, when Syme was middle-aged and at rest, he could\nnever see one of those particular objectsa lamppost, or an apple tree, or a\nwindmillwithout thinking that it was a strayed reveller from that revel of\nmasquerade.\n\nOn one side of this lawn, alive with dancers, was a sort of green bank, like\nthe terrace in such old-fashioned gardens.\n\nAlong this, in a kind of crescent, stood seven great chairs, the thrones of\nthe seven days. Gogol and Dr. Bull were already in their seats; the Professor\nwas just mounting to his. Gogol, or Tuesday, had his simplicity well\nsymbolised by a dress designed upon the division of the waters, a dress that\nseparated upon his forehead and fell to his feet, grey and silver, like a\nsheet of rain. The Professor, whose day was that on which the birds and\nfishesthe ruder forms of lifewere created, had a dress of dim purple, over\nwhich sprawled goggle-eyed fishes and outrageous tropical birds, the union in\nhim of unfathomable fancy and of doubt. Dr. Bull, the last day of Creation,\nwore a coat covered with heraldic animals in red and gold, and on his crest a\nman rampant. He lay back in his chair with a broad smile, the picture of an\noptimist in his element.\n\nOne by one the wanderers ascended the bank and sat in their strange seats. As\neach of them sat down a roar of enthusiasm rose from the carnival, such as\nthat with which crowds receive kings. Cups were clashed and torches shaken,\nand feathered hats flung in the air. The men for whom these thrones were\nreserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels. But the central\nchair was empty.\n\nSyme was on the left hand of it and the Secretary on the right. The Secretary\nlooked across the empty throne at Syme, and said, compressing his lips\n\nWe do not know yet that he is not dead in a field.\n\nAlmost as Syme heard the words, he saw on the sea of human faces in front of\nhim a frightful and beautiful alteration, as if heaven had opened behind his\nhead. But Sunday had only passed silently along the front like a shadow, and\nhad sat in the central seat. He was draped plainly, in a pure and terrible\nwhite, and his hair was like a silver flame on his forehead.\n\nFor a long timeit seemed for hoursthat huge masquerade of mankind swayed and\nstamped in front of them to marching and exultant music. Every couple dancing\nseemed a separate romance; it might be a fairy dancing with a pillar-box, or a\npeasant girl dancing with the moon; but in each case it was, somehow, as\nabsurd as Alice in Wonderland, yet as grave and kind as a love story. At last,\nhowever, the thick crowd began to thin itself. Couples strolled away into the\ngarden-walks, or began to drift towards that end of the building where stood\nsmoking, in huge pots like fish-kettles, some hot and scented mixtures of old\nale or wine. Above all these, upon a sort of black framework on the roof of\nthe house, roared in its iron basket a gigantic bonfire, which lit up the land\nfor miles. It flung the homely effect of firelight over the face of vast\nforests of grey or brown, and it seemed to fill with warmth even the emptiness\nof upper night. Yet this also, after a time, was allowed to grow fainter; the\ndim groups gathered more and more round the great cauldrons, or passed,\nlaughing and clattering, into the inner passages of that ancient house. Soon\nthere were only some ten loiterers in the garden; soon only four. Finally the\nlast stray merry-maker ran into the house whooping to his companions. The fire\nfaded, and the slow, strong stars came out. And the seven strange men were\nleft alone, like seven stone statues on their chairs of stone. Not one of them\nhad spoken a word.\n\nThey seemed in no haste to do so, but heard in silence the hum of insects and\nthe distant song of one bird. Then Sunday spoke, but so dreamily that he might\nhave been continuing a conversation rather than beginning one.\n\nWe will eat and drink later, he said. Let us remain together a little, we\nwho have loved each other so sadly, and have fought so long. I seem to\nremember only centuries of heroic war, in which you were always heroesepic on\nepic, iliad on iliad, and you always brothers in arms. Whether it was but\nrecently (for time is nothing), or at the beginning of the world, I sent you\nout to war. I sat in the darkness, where there is not any created thing, and\nto you I was only a voice commanding valour and an unnatural virtue. You heard\nthe voice in the dark, and you never heard it again. The sun in heaven denied\nit, the earth and sky denied it, all human wisdom denied it. And when I met\nyou in the daylight I denied it myself.\n\nSyme stirred sharply in his seat, but otherwise there was silence, and the\nincomprehensible went on.\n\nBut you were men. You did not forget your secret honour, though the whole\ncosmos turned an engine of torture to tear it out of you. I knew how near you\nwere to hell. I know how you, Thursday, crossed swords with King Satan, and\nhow you, Wednesday, named me in the hour without hope.\n\nThere was complete silence in the starlit garden, and then the black-browed\nSecretary, implacable, turned in his chair towards Sunday, and said in a harsh\nvoice\n\nWho and what are you?\n\nI am the Sabbath, said the other without moving. I am the peace of God.\n\nThe Secretary started up, and stood crushing his costly robe in his hand.\n\nI know what you mean, he cried, and it is exactly that that I cannot\nforgive you. I know you are contentment, optimism, what do they call the\nthing, an ultimate reconciliation. Well, I am not reconciled. If you were the\nman in the dark room, why were you also Sunday, an offense to the sunlight? If\nyou were from the first our father and our friend, why were you also our\ngreatest enemy? We wept, we fled in terror; the iron entered into our\nsoulsand you are the peace of God! Oh, I can forgive God His anger, though it\ndestroyed nations; but I cannot forgive Him His peace.\n\nSunday answered not a word, but very slowly he turned his face of stone upon\nSyme as if asking a question.\n\nNo, said Syme, I do not feel fierce like that. I am grateful to you, not\nonly for wine and hospitality here, but for many a fine scamper and free\nfight. But I should like to know. My soul and heart are as happy and quiet\nhere as this old garden, but my reason is still crying out. I should like to\nknow.\n\nSunday looked at Ratcliffe, whose clear voice said\n\nIt seems so silly that you should have been on both sides and fought\nyourself.\n\nBull said\n\nI understand nothing, but I am happy. In fact, I am going to sleep.\n\nI am not happy, said the Professor with his head in his hands, because I do\nnot understand. You let me stray a little too near to hell.\n\nAnd then Gogol said, with the absolute simplicity of a child\n\nI wish I knew why I was hurt so much.\n\nStill Sunday said nothing, but only sat with his mighty chin upon his hand,\nand gazed at the distance. Then at last he said\n\nI have heard your complaints in order. And here, I think, comes another to\ncomplain, and we will hear him also.\n\nThe falling fire in the great cresset threw a last long gleam, like a bar of\nburning gold, across the dim grass. Against this fiery band was outlined in\nutter black the advancing legs of a black-clad figure. He seemed to have a\nfine close suit with knee-breeches such as that which was worn by the servants\nof the house, only that it was not blue, but of this absolute sable. He had,\nlike the servants, a kind of sword by his side. It was only when he had come\nquite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at\nthem, that Syme saw, with thunder-struck clearness, that the face was the\nbroad, almost ape-like face of his old friend Gregory, with its rank red hair\nand its insulting smile.\n\nGregory! gasped Syme, half-rising from his seat. Why, this is the real\nanarchist!\n\nYes, said Gregory, with a great and dangerous restraint, I am the real\nanarchist.\n\nNow there was a day, murmured Bull, who seemed really to have fallen\nasleep, when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and\nSatan came also among them.\n\nYou are right, said Gregory, and gazed all round. I am a destroyer. I would\ndestroy the world if I could.\n\nA sense of a pathos far under the earth stirred up in Syme, and he spoke\nbrokenly and without sequence.\n\nOh, most unhappy man, he cried, try to be happy! You have red hair like\nyour sister.\n\nMy red hair, like red flames, shall burn up the world, said Gregory. I\nthought I hated everything more than common men can hate anything; but I find\nthat I do not hate everything so much as I hate you!\n\nI never hated you, said Syme very sadly.\n\nThen out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke.\n\nYou! he cried. You never hated because you never lived. I know what you are\nall of you, from first to lastyou are the people in power! You are the\npolicethe great fat, smiling men in blue and buttons! You are the Law, and\nyou have never been broken. But is there a free soul alive that does not long\nto break you, only because you have never been broken? We in revolt talk all\nkind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government.\nIt is all folly! The only crime of the Government is that it governs. The\nunpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme. I do not curse\nyou for being cruel. I do not curse you (though I might) for being kind. I\ncurse you for being safe! You sit in your chairs of stone, and have never come\ndown from them. You are the seven angels of heaven, and you have had no\ntroubles. Oh, I could forgive you everything, you that rule all mankind, if I\ncould feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as\nI\n\nSyme sprang to his feet, shaking from head to foot.\n\nI see everything, he cried, everything that there is. Why does each thing\non the earth war against each other thing? Why does each small thing in the\nworld have to fight against the world itself? Why does a fly have to fight the\nwhole universe? Why does a dandelion have to fight the whole universe? For the\nsame reason that I had to be alone in the dreadful Council of the Days. So\nthat each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the\nanarchist. So that each man fighting for order may be as brave and good a man\nas the dynamiter. So that the real lie of Satan may be flung back in the face\nof this blasphemer, so that by tears and torture we may earn the right to say\nto this man, You lie! No agonies can be too great to buy the right to say to\nthis accuser, We also have suffered.\n\nIt is not true that we have never been broken. We have been broken upon the\nwheel. It is not true that we have never descended from these thrones. We have\ndescended into hell. We were complaining of unforgettable miseries even at the\nvery moment when this man entered insolently to accuse us of happiness. I\nrepel the slander; we have not been happy. I can answer for every one of the\ngreat guards of Law whom he has accused. At least\n\nHe had turned his eyes so as to see suddenly the great face of Sunday, which\nwore a strange smile.\n\nHave you, he cried in a dreadful voice, have you ever suffered?\n\nAs he gazed, the great face grew to an awful size, grew larger than the\ncolossal mask of Memnon, which had made him scream as a child. It grew larger\nand larger, filling the whole sky; then everything went black. Only in the\nblackness before it entirely destroyed his brain he seemed to hear a distant\nvoice saying a commonplace text that he had heard somewhere, Can ye drink of\nthe cup that I drink of?\n\n* * * \n\nWhen men in books awake from a vision, they commonly find themselves in some\nplace in which they might have fallen asleep; they yawn in a chair, or lift\nthemselves with bruised limbs from a field. Symes experience was something\nmuch more psychologically strange if there was indeed anything unreal, in the\nearthly sense, about the things he had gone through. For while he could always\nremember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of Sunday, he could\nnot remember having ever come to at all. He could only remember that gradually\nand naturally he knew that he was and had been walking along a country lane\nwith an easy and conversational companion. That companion had been a part of\nhis recent drama; it was the red-haired poet Gregory. They were walking like\nold friends, and were in the middle of a conversation about some triviality.\nBut Syme could only feel an unnatural buoyancy in his body and a crystal\nsimplicity in his mind that seemed to be superior to everything that he said\nor did. He felt he was in possession of some impossible good news, which made\nevery other thing a triviality, but an adorable triviality.\n\nDawn was breaking over everything in colours at once clear and timid; as if\nNature made a first attempt at yellow and a first attempt at rose. A breeze\nblew so clean and sweet, that one could not think that it blew from the sky;\nit blew rather through some hole in the sky. Syme felt a simple surprise when\nhe saw rising all round him on both sides of the road the red, irregular\nbuildings of Saffron Park. He had no idea that he had walked so near London.\nHe walked by instinct along one white road, on which early birds hopped and\nsang, and found himself outside a fenced garden. There he saw the sister of\nGregory, the girl with the gold-red hair, cutting lilac before breakfast, with\nthe great unconscious gravity of a girl.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n    \n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    End of Project Gutenbergs The Man Who Was Thursday, by G.

YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\r\n    LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\r\n    PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.

LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\r\n    defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\r\n    receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\r\n    written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\r\n    received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\r\n    your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\r\n    the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\r\n    refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\r\n    providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\r\n    receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\r\n    is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\r\n    opportunities to fix the problem.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.4.

The invalidity or unenforceability of any\r\n    provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\n    trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\n    providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\n    with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\n    promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\n    harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\n    that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\n    or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    \r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\n    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\n    including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\n    because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\n    people in all walks of life.\r\n    \r\n    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\n    assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tms\r\n    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\n    remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\n    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\n    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\n    To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n    and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\n    and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\n    Literary Archive Foundation\r\n    \r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\n    spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\n    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\n    freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\n    array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\n    status with the IRS.\r\n    \r\n    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\n    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\n    States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\n    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\n    with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\n    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\n    SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\n    particular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n    \r\n    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\n    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\n    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\n    approach us with offers to donate.\r\n    \r\n    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\n    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\n    outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n    \r\n    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\n    methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\n    ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\n    To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\n    works.\r\n    \r\n    Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\n    with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\n    editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\n    unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\n    keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n    \r\n         http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n    \r\n    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\n    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\n    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\n    subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \n\n'
