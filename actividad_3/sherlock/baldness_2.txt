Three main types of alopecia (androgenic [AGA], areata\n[AA] and chemotherapy-induced [CIA]) are very different, and have their own\nlaboratory models and separate drug-discovery efforts.\n\n ** _Areas covered:_** In this article, the authors review the biology of\nhair, hair follicle (HF) cycling, stem cells and signaling pathways. AGA, due\nto dihydrotesterone, is treated by 5- reductase inhibitors, androgen receptor\nblockers and ATP-sensitive potassium channel-openers. AA, which involves\nattack by CD8+NK group 2D-positive (NKG2D+) T cells, is treated with\nimmunosuppressives, biologics and JAK inhibitors. Meanwhile, CIA is treated by\napoptosis inhibitors, cytokines and topical immunotherapy.\n\n ** _Expert opinion:_** The desire to treat alopecia with an easy topical\npreparation is expected to grow with time, particularly with an increasing\naging population. The discovery of epidermal stem cells in the HF has given\nnew life to the search for a cure for baldness. Drug discovery efforts are\nbeing increasingly centered on these stem cells, boosting the hair cycle and\nreversing miniaturization of HF. Better understanding of the molecular\nmechanisms underlying the immune attack in AA will yield new drugs. New\ndiscoveries in HF neogenesis and low-level light therapy will undoubtedly have\na role to play.\n\nKeywords: 5--reductase inhibitor, alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, anti-\nandrogen, baldness, chemotherapy-induced alopecia, hair follicle, low-level\nlaser (light) therapy, stem cells, topical immunotherapy\n\n## Additional information\n\n### Declaration of interest\n\nZ Santos was supported by CAPES grant 99999.002158/2014-00.
