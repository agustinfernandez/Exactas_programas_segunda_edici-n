Hence, we performed the present meta-analysis\nbased on all eligible cohort and casecontrol studies.\n\n### Methods:\n\nA comprehensive literature search was performed in October 2017 based on\nPubMed and Web of Science databases. Pooled relative risk (RR) and its 95%\nconfidence interval (95% CI) was calculated with a DerSimonian and Laird\nrandom-effects model.\n\n### Results:\n\nA total of 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, no\nstatistically significant association between baldness (any pattern) and\nprostate cancer risk was identified (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.961.11). There was\nobvious heterogeneity across included studies ( _P_ < .078 for heterogeneity,\n_I_ _2_ = 36.4%). When subgroup analysis by types of baldness, a statistically\nsignificant association was observed for vertex baldness (RR 1.24, 95% CI\n1.051.46) but not for other types of baldness.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nIndividuals with vertex baldness may have an increased risk of prostate\ncancer. Given the obvious heterogeneity and null results in overall analysis\nand most of subgroup analyses, further large well-designed prospective cohort\nstudies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nProstate cancer is the second-most commonly diagnosed cancer among men\nworldwide, with a total of 1,111,700 new cases and 307,500 deaths estimated in\n2012.[1] With the wide utilization of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)\ntesting, a growing number of prostate cancer cases at local or regional stages\nhave been diagnosed.[2] The only well-established risk factors for prostate\ncancer are age, race/ethnicity, and family history of prostate cancer.[3]\nHence, an additional study to improve our understanding of the etiology of\nprostate cancer is warranted.\n\nRecently, several researchers have explored whether male pattern baldness (or\nandrogenic alopecia) is a potential indicator for future prostate cancer\nincidence, as male pattern baldness seems to share pathologic mechanisms with\nprostate cancer, such as advancing age, hereditability, and endogenous\nhormones.[4,5] As male pattern baldness generally occurs decades earlier than\nprostate cancer, baldness may serve as a potential noninvasive screening\nindicator for prostate cancer if a clear association between male pattern\nbaldness and prostate cancer could be established. However, findings from\nprevious epidemiologic studies on the relationship between male pattern\nbaldness and prostate cancer risk are inconclusive due to the different study\ndesigns, limited sample size, various baldness measurements and\nclassification, and time window (age of baldness onset). Al Edwan et al,[6]\nZeigler-Johnson et al,[7] and Giles et al[8] reported a significant positive\nassociation of baldness with prostate cancer risk, while many other\nepidemiological studies failed to confirm this association.\n\nGiven the conflicting findings in literature as discussed above, we performed\nthe present systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize evidence on the\nassociation of male pattern baldness with risk of prostate cancer.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n### 2.1 Literature search\n\nA comprehensive literature search was performed in October 2017 based on\nPubMed and Web of Science databases with the following search algorithm:\n(baldness or alopecia or hair loss) and (prostate cancer or prostate\nneoplasm or prostatic carcinoma). In addition, the reference lists of\nretrieved articles and related reviews were checked to identify any potential\nrelevant studies. No language or publication date restrictions were adopted.\nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis was designed, performed, and\nreported in accordance with the standards of quality for reporting a\nsystematic review and meta-analysis.[9]\n\n### 2.2 Selection criteria\n\nArticles included in this study had to meet all the following criteria: the\nexposure of interest was male pattern baldness; the outcome of interest was\nrisk of prostate cancer; study design was cohort, nested casecontrol, or\ncase-control; and the risk estimates with their corresponding 95% CIs were\nreported or sufficient data were provided to calculate them. If multiple\narticles used the same study population, the article with the largest sample\nsize was included in the present meta-analysis.\n\n### 2.3 Quality assessment\n\nNewcastleOttawa Scale (NOS) was introduced to evaluate the quality of\nincluded studied by two independent authors (HH and BX). NOS is a 9-star\nsystem, which includes 3 dimensions: selection (4 items), comparability (1\nitem), and exposure/outcome (3 items)\n(http://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp). Each item\nrepresents 1 point, except for comparability (2 points). A study with  7\npoints was considered as a high-quality study.\n\n### 2.4 Data extraction\n\nData were extracted independently by the same 2 authors (HH and BX) and any\ndiscrepancies were resolved by discussion. The following information from each\nincluded study were recorded: first author\'s surname, the country where the\nstudy was conducted, study design, publication year, age of study population,\nsample size and number of cases, types of baldness, fully adjusted risk\nestimates with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and\nmatched or adjusted variables in the study design or statistical analysis.\n\n### 2.5 Statistical methods\n\nConsidering that prostate cancer is a rare disease, the odds ratio (OR) was\nassumed approximately the same as relative risk (RR), and the RR was adopted\nas the study outcome. Pooled RR and its 95% CI was calculated with a\nDerSimonian and Laird random-effects model,[10] which takes account for both\nwithin- and between-study variability. For studies that reported separate\neffect size estimates for different types of baldness, we combined these risk\nestimates within each study, weighted by inverse of the variance.[11] Subgroup\nanalyses were performed based on geographical region, types of baldness, age\nof baldness onset, study design, and stage of prostate cancer.\n\nHeterogeneity across included studies was assessed with the Cochran _Q_ test\n(the level of significance was set at 0.1).[12] The _I_ _2_ score was also\nused to determine the degree of heterogeneity ( _I_ _2_ < 25%, no obvious\nheterogeneity; _I_ _2_ = 2550%, moderate heterogeneity; _I_ _2_ > 50%, large\nor extreme heterogeneity).[12] Finally, Galbraith plot [13] was introduced to\nidentify the studies that contributed to the heterogeneity and meta-analysis\nwas performed again after removing these studies.\n\nIn sensitivity analysis, meta-analysis was reconducted after omitting each\nstudy in turn. Potential publication bias was evaluated with Begg test [14]\nand Egger test.[15] Statistical analyses were completed with STATA 11.0\n(StataCorp, College Station, TX), using 2-sided _P_ values (set at .05). All\nanalyses of this meta-analysis were based on previous published studies, and\nthis meta-analysis did not have original data. Thus, no ethical approval and\npatient consent are required.\n\n## 3 Results\n\n### 3.1 Study search and characteristics\n\nThe detailed process of literature search is shown in Fig. 1. A total of 15\neligible studies [68,1627] were finally included in the present meta-\nanalysis. These studies were carried out in the following geographical\nregions: Europe (n = 5), North America (n = 8), and Oceania (n = 2). There\nwere 4 cohort studies and 11 casecontrol studies, which were published\nbetween 1997 and 2016. Information on exposure (male pattern baldness) was\ncollected by face-to-face interview or self-reported questionnaire. Study\noutcome (prostate cancer) was histopathologically proved in most of the\nincluded studies. Quality scores evaluated by the NewcastleOttawa Scale (NOS)\nranged from 5 to 8. The main characteristics of all included studies have been\nsummarized in Table 1.\n\nFigure 1:\n\nLiterature search and study selection.\n\nTable 1:\n\nSummary characteristics of the studies included in this meta-analysis.\n\n### 3.2 Overall analysis and heterogeneity assessment\n\nMultivariable adjusted RRs with their 95% CIs extracted from each included\nstudy that evaluated baldness (any pattern) and prostate cancer risk are\npresent in Fig. 2. Overall, in a random effects model combining these studies,\nno statistically significant association between baldness (any pattern) and\nprostate cancer risk was identified (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.961.11). There was\nstatistically significant heterogeneity across included studies ( _P_ < .078\nfor heterogeneity, _I_ _2_ = 36.4%). Thus, we adopted the Galbraith plot to\nexplore the studies that led to the heterogeneity. Consequently, studies by Al\nEdwan et al,[6] Zeigler-Johnson et al,[7] and Giles et al[8] were the major\nsources of heterogeneity (Fig. 3). Overall analysis was reconducted after\nomitting these 3 studies. The heterogeneity was disappeared ( _P_ = .908, _I_\n_2_ = 0.0%), while the trend direction of combined risk estimate was not\nchanged (RR: 0.99, 95% CI 0.941.04).\n\nFigure 2:\n\nA forest plot showing effect size estimates from casecontrol and cohort\nstudies evaluating the association between male pattern baldness and prostate\ncancer risk.\n\nFigure 3:\n\nGalbraith plot analysis was performed to detect potential sources of\nheterogeneity.\n\n### 3.3 Subgroup analysis\n\nNext, we performed stratified analyses according to various study\ncharacteristics (Table 2). When stratified analysis by geographical regions,\nthe RRs with 95% CIs were 0.96 (0.861.06), 1.07 (0.951.20), and 1.07\n(0.891.29) for Europe, North America, and Oceania, respectively. When further\nsubgroup analysis was done by types of baldness, statistically significant\nassociation was observed for vertex baldness (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.051.46) but\nnot for other types of baldness. We then conducted stratified analysis by\nstudy design, the analysis limited to cohort studies yielded an RR of 0.99\n(95% CI 0.931.04), and the analysis for casecontrol studies yielded an RR of\n1.11 (95% CI 0.981.25). In the subgroup analysis by stage of prostate cancer,\nthe RRs with 95% CIs were 1.04 (0.921.17) and 1.14 (0.961.35) for\nnonaggressive and aggressive prostate cancer, respectively. Finally, in the\nstratified analysis by the age of baldness onset, male pattern baldness at age\n20 years, age 30 years, and age 40 years were not associated with overall\nprostate cancer risk.\n\nTable 2:\n\nSubgroup analysis of the association between male pattern baldness and risk of\nprostate cancer.\n\n### 3.4 Sensitivity analysis and publication bias\n\nSensitivity analysis was performed to determine the influence of each included\nstudy on the pooled RR by repeating the meta-analysis after removing each\nstudy in turn. As shown in Fig. 4, no individual study obviously dominated the\npooled RR. The 15 study-specific RRs ranged from a low of 1.01 (95% CI\n0.941.08) to a high of 1.05 (95% CI 0.981.13) after omitting the study by\nGiles et al [8] and the study by Sarre et al,[26] respectively. Finally, no\nsignificant publication bias was detected by Begg test (Fig. 5, _P_ = .428) or\nEgger test ( _P_ = .627).\n\nFigure 4:\n\nSensitivity analysis was carried out by omitting each study in turn and\nrecalculating the pooled risk estimates.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nPublication bias was evaluated by Begg test.\n\n## 4 Discussion\n\nThe present systematic review and meta-analysis summarized the relationship\nbetween male pattern baldness and incidence of prostate cancer based on 4\ncohort studies and 11 casecontrol studies. Overall, there was no\nstatistically significant association between baldness (any pattern) and\nprostate cancer risk (RR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.961.11). However, in the subgroup\nanalysis by types of baldness, a statistically significant association was\nobserved for vertex baldness (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.051.46).\n\nThe results of our meta-analysis were basically in accordance with a previous\nmeta-analysis by Amoretti et al published in 2013,[28] which only included 7\ncasecontrol studies. They also found that any pattern baldness was not\nassociated with a significant increase in the risk of prostate cancer, but\nindividuals with vertex baldness had a higher incidence of prostate cancer.\nAfter their study was reported, emerging studies, especially cohort studies,\non this topic have been published with conflicting results. Hence, we\nperformed the present updated meta-analysis to summarize all available\nevidence. Furthermore, we also analyzed age-specific baldness in relation to\nprostate cancer risk and the association of male pattern baldness with\ndifferent stage of prostate cancer, which were not presented in the previous\nmeta-analysis.\n\nMale pattern baldness is considered as a common progressive hair-loss process\nin a well-defined pattern and seems to share common pathophysiological\nmechanisms with prostate cancer (i.e., age, heritability and endogenous\nhormones).[4,5] Both incidences of male pattern baldness and prostate cancer\nincrease with advancing age. Inherited genetic factors contribute to 81% of\nmale pattern baldness [5] and 42% of prostate cancer risk.[4] A multistage\ngenome-wide association study has identified more than 40 prostate cancer\nsusceptibility loci, explaining 25% of the familial risk in this disease.[29]\nSeveral independent studies indicated that some androgen receptor (AR)\npolyglycine repeat polymorphisms might confer susceptibility to androgenetic\nalopecia.[3032] As for endogenous hormones, both hair follicles and the\nprostate gland respond to stimulation of androgen. Individuals with baldness\nseem to have a higher level of circulating androgens than those without.[33]\nHigh circulating androgens have been reported to be associated with an\nincreased risk of prostate cancer,[16,34] although the evidence in\nepidemiologic studies are still conflicting.[35] Considering that male pattern\nbaldness happens decades earlier than prostate cancer, baldness may serve as a\npotential noninvasive indicator for screening of prostate cancer if a clear\nassociation between male pattern baldness and prostate cancer could be\nconfirmed by large well-designed cohort studies.\n\nThe present study had some strengths. A total of 15 epidemiologic studies were\nincluded in this systematic review and meta-analysis, which improved the\nstatistical power and reported more reliable estimates compared with any\nindividual study. Various subgroup analyses according to key characteristics\nwere performed, which provided a comprehensive and in-depth evaluation of the\nrelationship between male baldness and prostate cancer. Sensitivity analyses\nand Galbraith plot were carried out to confirm the robustness of pooled risk\nestimate. The effect size estimates were extracted from fully adjusted models\nin each study, which might minimize the potential confounding. No obvious\npublication bias was observed in Begg test or Egger test.\n\nHowever, several important limitations should also be acknowledged in this\nstudy. First, statistical significantly heterogeneity was detected across\nincluded studies ( _P_ < .078 for heterogeneity, _I_ _2_ = 36.4%), which might\naffect the robustness of the pooled risk estimates. We removed the studies\nthat contributed to the heterogeneity via the Galbraith plot and recalculated\nthe combined RR, which did not remain significant (RR: 0.99, 95% CI\n0.941.04). This result implied that the overall analysis was not\nsubstantially affected by the heterogeneity. Second, most of the eligible\nstudies were casecontrol studies, which were less conclusive than cohort\nstudies and might introduce the select bias and recall bias. Third, although\nthe majority of the included studies adopted the NorwoodHamilton scale to\nassess the baldness, differences in exposure assessment still existed, which\nmight distort the combined risk estimates. Finally, gray literature (e.g.,\nconference abstracts) and studies reported in languages other than English or\nChinese were less likely to be retrieved, which might lead to a certain degree\nof publication bias.\n\nIn conclusion, this systematic review and meta-analysis allowed us to perform\noverall analysis of male pattern baldness with prostate cancer risk, as well\nas various subgroup analyses with strong statistical power. As a result, we\nfound that individuals with vertex baldness had an increased risk of prostate\ncancer. Given the obvious heterogeneity and null results in overall analysis\nand most of subgroup analyses, further large well-designed prospective cohort\nstudies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings.\n\n## Author contributions\n\n**Conceptualization:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Data curation:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Formal analysis:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Funding acquisition:** Liping Xie.\n\n**Investigation:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Methodology:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Project administration:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Resources:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Software:** Huadong He, Liping Xie.\n\n**Supervision:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Validation:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Visualization:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Writing  original draft:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n**Writing  review & editing:** Huadong He, Bo Xie, Liping Xie.\n\n## References\n\n[1].
