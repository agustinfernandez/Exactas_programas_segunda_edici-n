By outlining plausible mechanistic\nlinks between individual decision-making, information flow in populations and\ncompetition between groups, models of cultural evolution offer a novel and\npowerful approach for integrating multiple levels of explanation of fertility\ntransitions. However, only a modest number of models have been published.\nTheir assumptions often differ from those in other evolutionary approaches to\nsocial behaviour, but their empirical predictions are often similar. Here I\noffer the first overview of cultural evolutionary research on demographic\ntransition, critically compare it with approaches taken by other evolutionary\nresearchers, identify gaps and overlaps, and highlight parallel debates in\ndemography. I suggest that researchers divide their labour between three\ndistinct phases of fertility declinethe origin, spread and maintenance of low\nfertilityeach of which may be driven by different causal processes, at\ndifferent scales, requiring different theoretical and empirical tools. A\ncomparative, multi-level and mechanistic framework is essential for\nelucidating both the evolved aspects of our psychology that govern\nreproductive decision-making, and the social, ecological and cultural\ncontingencies that precipitate and sustain fertility decline.\n\n### 1\\. Introduction\n\nThe global transition to low fertility is one of the most striking cultural\nconvergences in human history. Over the past 200 years, people from different\nreligious, linguistic, ethnic and cultural groups, living in economies with\ndifferent histories and value-systems, are increasingly limiting their\nfamilies to around two or fewer children. How has this social norm evolved?\nCan it last? And can we connect theories about how people make personal\nreproductive decisions with the evolution of a broader culture that\nincreasingly values and rewards smaller families?\n\nFor decades, researchers of demographic transition have argued that economic,\ncultural, ideational and sociological factors are too deeply intertwined in\nthis process to be completely isolated from each other [15]. Asserting the\ncausal primacy of one of these dimensions is therefore problematic.\nDemographic transitions are also multi-level phenomena, driven by nested sets\nof social interactions [6]. These involve people living in social networks,\nkinship groups, socioeconomic classes and communities, followed by\ninteractions between these entities and between regions and countries in a\nglobal network. The challenge then is to explain both substantial within- and\nbetween-society variation in the trajectories of fertility decline, and the\nglobal convergence on low fertility as a general process, while doing justice\nto the coevolutionary nature of economic, cultural and population change.\n\nEvolutionary theorists have produced many abstract treatments of the dynamics\nof fertility decline at different levels of analysis. Evolutionary\nanthropologists have been testing aspects of these models for at least 30\nyears [5,710]. This work has mostly focused on the predictions of optimality\napproaches, or on critically comparing how socioeconomic and sociocultural\ncharacteristics of individuals predict their fertility outcomes [1113]. There\nare now strong lines of enquiry on reproductive competition and cooperation\nwithin families, reproductive trade-offs and other allocation decisions, life-\nhistory and context-dependent variation in reproductive behaviour [14]. Much\nof this is consistent with mainstream demography but with additional insights\ngained from thinking about why any animal would ever reduce fertility in a\ntime of plenty.\n\nIn principle, causal models combining economic and cultural factors are a\nshared objective. Empirically, this is a daunting task. In practice, little\nwork has been done to actually synthesize different conceptual approaches\n[12,15,16], with little explicit focus on how cultural transmission\ncontributes toor derailsadaptive reproductive behaviour. Partly, this is\nbecause many evolutionary anthropologists and demographers identify as human\nbehavioural ecologists (HBEs), taking inspiration from animal models of\nbehaviour in evolutionary biology and sharing common conceptual ground with\neconomists [17]. They share interests in life-history theory, resource-\nallocation strategies, context-dependent adaptation and fitness optimization\n[18,19]. However, it is also partly because theoretical models of cultural\nevolution (CE) have been less widely read and are thought more difficult to\ntest.\n\nCultural evolutionists have long been interested in the demographic\ntransition. Founding texts in the field [20,21] emphasized fertility decline\nas a canonical example of how cultural transmission can drive behavioural\noutcomes that do not maximize genetic fitness. CEs regularly raise fertility\ndecline as a counterpoint, both to exclusive reliance on optimality approaches\nand to assumptions about adaptive lag in contemporary human behaviour\n[22,23]. Given that low fertility rates in the advanced economies of the world\ncannot be considered fitness-maximizing [2427], CE is gaining traction among\nempirical researchers [12,13,15,16,28,29]. But only a few models are widely\ncited and discussed [8,14].\n\nMoreover, some conceptual overlaps between CE and HBE can make them difficult\nto distinguish as alternative explanatory frameworks. Perhaps as a result, CE\ntheory has not made inroads into mainstream demographic thinking, despite a\ngrowing representation of evolutionary research in that literature [30]. This\nis unfortunate, given demographers' longstanding debates about demand versus\nideation theories of demographic transition [1,31,32], their interest in the\nrelative contributions of cultural and economic processes to this phenomenon\n[3234], and their aspirations to integrate micro- and macro-level\nunderstandings of demographic change [6]. Indeed, the main cleavages in the\nevolutionary literature closely parallel those in demography, with debate\nsurrounding the role of rational-actors [28,35] and methodological\nindividualism, dichotomies between economic and cultural explanations of\nfertility decline [12,28] and the importance of social versus individual\nlearning [21,35,36] (though defined differently than in demography [37], see\n2b).\n\nEvolutionary research on fertility decline needs to address the multi-level\nnature of human social interaction, which generates opportunities for\nevolutionary dynamics that both involve reciprocal causation and are not\neasily reduced to individual characteristics [15,23,38]. A multi-level\napproach highlights that different parts of the system of demographic\ntransition might be driven by different evolutionary processes. Fertility\ndecline has three distinguishable phasesthe origins, spread and maintenance\nof low fertilityeach of which may require different theoretical and empirical\ntools and may occur on different scales. Rather than pitting particular\nframeworks against each other, developing and testing hypotheses that draw on\na principled synthesis of theoretical outlooks will undoubtedly be more\nproductive.\n\nWe need clearly testable predictions from CE models and clarification of\nconceptual overlaps that are hampering theoretical integration. HBE's\ncommitment to the behavioural gambit [39]a black-box approach to how\noptimization problems are solvedallows researchers to focus on the fitness\ncosts and benefits to reproduction and on the evolutionary functions of\nreproductive decision-making [18]. But the causal structure linking individual\ndecisions to those of other people and to higher-level patterns remains poorly\nunderstood. Mechanistic explanations of fertility decline are needed at the\nvery least because there are multiple ways for individuals and populations to\nreach (or to miss) optimal solutions [3941].\n\nThis review argues for a deeper integration of CE theory into (evolutionary)\ndemography, as a means to develop multi-level models of fertility decline that\nemphasize the coevolution of economic and cultural change and not the _a\npriori_ privileging of one over the other. I begin by reviewing some basic\nconceptual differences between different evolutionary approaches, noting\nsimilarities and departures from standard demographic thinking, before briefly\noutlining the CE work published to date. This is followed by conceptual\noverlaps and a critical comparison of how data on demographic transitions are\ninterpreted by different sub-fields. Finally, I offer some new directions that\ncan generate novel hypotheses about the dynamics of fertility decline from an\nevolutionary perspective.\n\n### 2\\. Basic differences affecting how low fertility is interpreted\n\nThere are a number of different ways to think about fertility decline from an\nevolutionary perspective (table 1). Each raises challenging and unresolved\ntheoretical questions about: the nature of reproductive success in the\ncontemporary world, the psychological mechanisms we think are at play, whether\nlow fertility should be considered adaptive or not, what level of analysis is\nnecessary and what aspects of contemporary and recent environments precipitate\nor slow down reproductive change.\n\n__Table 1.

First, we could decide that\nfertility decline is a mismatch (a case of adaptive lag) [22]. Our\npsychologies did not evolve to explicitly focus on family size but to strive\nfor sex and status. Two hundred years is not enough time for us to adapt to\nthe abundant resources of today's market economies and efficient\ncontraceptives can now sever the link between sex and reproduction. Many\nevolutionary psychologists take this approach, but there is almost no\ntheoretical work on fertility decline from this perspective, so I will not\ndiscuss it further. Second, we could assume that our psychologies evolved to\ndo a good job of parsing the costs and benefits of reproduction in any\nenvironment. We would then focus on the trade-offs imposed by contemporary\nenvironments, how these might differ from ancestral ones, and how they might\nincentivize low fertility [71]. This route is taken by many HBEs. Third, we\ncould assume that reproduction, like all behaviour, takes place within a\ncultural environment that itself defines opportunities and payoffs and the way\nthese are perceived, through shared norms and values, themselves the product\nof CE in structured populations. Here we might on one level want to understand\nhow biases in the way we learn from one anotherbiases that evolved to help us\nefficiently acquire adaptive behaviouraffect reproduction and are subject to\nnew structural, cultural and transmission constraints, or to the lifting of\nold ones. Or on how variation, competition and selection at multiple levels of\nsocial organization conspire to generate downward pressure on fertility. CEs\ntypically take this tack.\n\n#### (a) The view from human behavioural ecology\n\nHBE is generally concerned with uncovering and understanding the costs and\nbenefits of low fertility for individuals or lineages by examining constraints\non fitness maximization, in particular how fundamental trade-offs, parental\ninvestment strategies and reproductive competition drive fertility outcomes.\nPersonal decision-making on this approach is analogous to economic decision-\nmaking and research on fertility decline often draws on economic models of the\nfamily [17] and extensions and variations by evolutionary researchers\n[10,27,71]. These costbenefit decisions differ in one important respect: the\nutility being maximizedfitnessis explicit. If behaviour can be considered\noptimal (i.e. fitness-maximizing, given constraints), HBE is not generally\nconcerned about the decision-mechanisms that generate adaptive fit between\nbehaviour and environment [19]. While recognizing that social interactions and\ncultural transmission are importantthe term socio-ecology is employed to\nreflect this understandingHBE generally considers these as constraints on\n(information relevant to) adaptive decision-making, and thus as proximate\nmechanisms [18]. This stance is changing, because the behaviour in question is\nclearly not one that maximizes fitness [2426].\n\nIn all species, the energetics of reproduction is tied to resource\naccumulation, but humans evolved in a skill-intensive foraging niche, which\nrequires investment in embodied capital (skill, physical strength, local\nknowledge) to obtain resources, as well as extra-somatic and other forms of\nwealth [10]. A leading explanation of fertility decline is that market\neconomies increase the returns to parental investment in new forms of embodied\ncapital (in the form of education), generating trade-offs between the quality\nand the quantity of children produced [10,7274]. Subsistence economies that\nrely on extra-somatic wealth for marriage and reproductive opportunities may\nalso generate conditions for the coevolution of low fertility preferences and\nsocial institutions promoting inheritance of material wealth [7,10,43,49,50].\n\nEarly models of fertility decline [7,43] showed how increasing the opportunity\ncosts of both marriage and raising children can in principle decrease optimal\nfertility to very low levels. Additionally, if children differ in their\nreproductive value (i.e. expected reproductive success), then parents should\nexhibit reproductive restraint, maximizing the cumulative value of their\nchildren, and not simply the number [42]. Null or negative relationships\nbetween wealth, status and the number of children born, as are typically found\nin post-demographic transition populations, do not rule out a positive\nrelationship between wealth and reproductive value [26,27,42]. Arms races of\nparental investment in quality could then drive the evolution of low\nfertility, especially in socially stratified populations where competition may\noccur within rather than between social strata [42,44,45,47,48].\n\nA number of researchers have proposed that long-term fitness, or the success\nof lineages, is theoretically increased by decreasing fertility in the short-\nterm (e.g. [49], though see [51]). Diluting resources between lots of children\nincreases the chances that they will be downwardly mobile, so low fertility\ncould be an adaptive strategy to help avoid this outcome (or increase the\nprobability of upward mobility) [50]. If individuals are risk- or variance-\nsensitive, over-producing when mortality uncertainty is high and under-\nproducing when it is low [52,53], then periodic environmental crises or\nstochastic fluctuations could also make it sensible to pursue a low fertility\nstrategy, again enabling lineages to survive [48] (see also [45,54,75]). This\nmakes sense because if resources became limited, and access to them was\nunequal, then wealthy and/or high-status families could thrive at the expense\nof the rest of the population. That being said, where this kind of scenario\nhas been modelled [45], the conditions under which low-fertility, late-\nbreeding lineages persist at the expense of high-fertility, early-breeding\nones have proved extremely difficult to create.\n\nUltimately, for low fertility to be evolutionarily as opposed to economically\nadvantageous, there has to be a fitness payoff to having fewer high-quality\nchildren, in either the short or the long term; we need to see low-fertility\nfamilies cashing in on their advantage in reproductive terms at some point.\nTo date, no evidence has justified this assumption [2426] and a number of\nimportant conceptual issues remain unclear. How many generations should we\nconsider, and why switch from a one- to a multi-generational strategy? Why\nswitch the evolutionary currencies being maximized? Do children in smaller\nfamilies meaningfully differ in their reproductive value? Other important\ncomponents of fitness include survival to reproductive age, ability to find a\npartner and recruitment of children into the reproducing population, and\nnatural selection operating on some or all of these components could in\nprinciple drive fertility decline.\n\n#### (b) The view from cultural evolution\n\nCE work relevant to understanding demographic transition has broadly focused\non three different areas: (i) how individual learning biases that evolved to\noptimize social information transmission generate and maintain different\nfrequencies of cultural traits in populations; (ii) how variation and\ninteraction between groups at different cultural equilibria lead to between-\ngroup competition, selection and transmission; and (iii) how different\nchannels (modes) of social transmission affect the dynamics of information\nflow in populations. CE theory takes inspiration from both population genetic\nmodels and social psychology, and offers a multi-level approach to social\nbehaviour, emphasizing that individual strategies for adaptation within groups\nand competition between groups are often co-occurring [76]. CEs commonly\ndefine _culture_ as social information transmitted via teaching, learning and\nimitation [20,21], similarly to how ideation is construed in demography.\nMore broadly though, CE considers cross-culturally and temporally stable\ninstitutions and traditions, including the economy itself, to be socially\nconstructed, coevolving entities, and not as wholly exogenous (extrinsic)\nconstraints on decision-making [23]. Unlike optimality models, in many CE\nmodels the fitness of a particular cultural trait is inferred from frequency\nchanges in the population, assuming certain learning-rules, rather than by\npre-defined utility functions measured purely at the individual level.\n\nSocial learning mechanisms evolved to enhance genetic fitness [20,21,77]. CE\nmodels distinguish three general types of learning bias: content-, context-\nand frequency-dependent [77]. Content bias (also called direct bias [21]) is\nsimilar to costbenefit analysis (also called asocial or individual learning).\nThe individual selects a cultural trait based on its perceived intrinsic\nutility. Under context biases, individuals adopt traits based on the\ncharacteristics of the person (or social model) who exhibits it (also called\nindirect bias [21]). This allows learners to avoid the costs of asocial\nlearning using some cue about the suitability of social models, for example\nsuccess in a particular domain, or deference (prestige) shown by third parties\n[62]. The costthat these cues may not be related to the behavioural trait in\nquestiongenerates trade-offs between rapid social learning and the adoption\nof maladaptive traits [78]. Frequency-dependent biases use the frequency of a\ntrait or behaviour in a group as a cue to its utility. Individuals may weight\nthese frequencies positively (conformist bias) or negatively (anti-conformist\nbias), generating nonlinear adoption patterns in the population [21,67].\nAlternatively, people may simply randomly copy the most frequent behaviours\nthey observe (neutral frequency-dependence). Individuals are expected to\ntrade-off the costs and benefits to social and asocial learning, leading to\nconditional learning strategies [79]. Within a population, a balance of\ninformation production (asocial learning) and scrounging (social learning)\nis needed for behaviour to remain connected to ecological variation [36,77].\n\nConformist bias is argued to be especially important in maintaining between-\ngroup variation, by increasing differences between groups while maintaining\nsimilarities within them [80]. This variation, coupled with competition\nbetween groups, is the driver of the cultural group selection model of the\nevolution of aspects of human behaviour [63]. Conformist bias is similarly\nargued to underlie the S-shaped adoption curves associated with the diffusion\nof innovations [67,81] by inhibiting uptake when innovations are rare, and\naccelerating take-off once a critical threshold of adopters is reached. This\nis similar to how social influence works in demography [37], defined as the\nsocial power that interpersonal interactions at various levels have over\nindividual decisions, through basic human tendencies of conflict-avoidance,\ndeference to authority, and the sanctioning ability of powerful individuals or\ninstitutions. By contrast, the costbenefit analysis advocated in HBE is more\ncomparable to social learning in demography, defined almost as a Bayesian\nprocess whereby a set of subjective beliefs are continuously updated through\ndrawing on both asocial and social information [37].\n\nCultural traits can be acquired from many other people and modified by\nindividuals within their lifetime. They can also make their bearers more\nvisible as social models. Moreover, since information is transmitted\nhorizontally (peer-to-peer) and obliquely (from non-parents of an older\ngeneration) as well as vertically (from parents-to-children) [20], there is\nample room for maladaptive traits to quickly spread in a population without\nrelying heavily on particular biases for explanatory power. Oblique and\nhorizontal transmission should be most efficient at diffusing new traits in a\npopulation because of their asymmetric (one-to-many) nature. Vertical\ntransmission is analogous to genetic transmission and should thus result in a\nslower process of cultural change [20]. These can be understood as individual\nlevel mechanisms (e.g. you receive information from a person defined as a\nhorizontal or a vertical source) or as group-level properties (i.e. the rate\nof transmission in a group or the proportion of total information transmitted\nvia a particular channel).\n\n### 3\\. Cultural evolutionary models of fertility decline\n\nWhile social learning biases are somewhat integrated into evolutionary\ndiscussions of fertility decline in HBE, the almost exclusive focus on\nindividual-level mechanisms has led to a neglect of the second two components\nof CE research outlined above: group-level dynamics and modes of transmission.\nCE models of fertility decline have focused more on trade-offs between\ncultural and biological success [21,55] than on those between quantity and\nquality (as is typical in HBE), but also on how changing social structures\n[57,60] and dynamics [58,59] of social transmission affect the diffusion of\ninformation about reproduction. This research falls broadly into three areas\nfocusing on the origins, spread and maintenance of fertility decline.\n\n#### (a) Origins\n\nThere is some debate as to whether CE can successfully explain the origins, as\nopposed to the spread, and perhaps maintenance of low fertility [8], but in\nfact some early treatments focused on just this aspect [21,55]. Richerson &\nBoyd [55] showed that small differences in peoples' tendency to become\ncultural parents as opposed to biological parents could lead to natural\nselection on fitness-reducing behaviour, with status-competition driving\ntrade-offs between cultural and reproductive success [21]. Only one individual\ncan become a CEO, for example, but most people can become parents. Stiff\ncompetition for prestige positions in modernizing populations could generate\nselective pressure for status-acquisition behaviour that requires a trade-off\nwith fertility, consistent with other causal models in HBE, though the\nmechanisms may differ (table 1). If achieving status (i.e. becoming a cultural\nparent) is associated with even marginally more social visibility than being a\nbiological parent, then high-status individuals have privileged leverage to\nasymmetrically transmit their values to other people (i.e. one-to-many).\nNote that this does not presuppose active transmission, only that social\nvisibility makes one's values and trade-offs more easily observable. Note also\nthat I use low fertility preferences as shorthand here: these can refer to\nany preferences that have low fertility as their downstream outcome. Teachers,\nfor example [35], are privileged oblique and horizontal transmitters of\neducational values, while also embodying the trait being transmitted. From the\ncultural-traits-eye view then, the high-education phenotype promotes itself\nbetter by being associated with high-social status than with high fertility.\n\n#### (b) Spread\n\nThe most cited CE arguments on fertility decline emphasize prestige-bias in\nthe spread of low-fertility behaviour [35]. Prestige-bias feeds off the\nprocess just described; once culturally successful social models exist, other\nindividuals can adopt their fertility-limiting behaviours. More generally, if\nthis kind of one-to-many transmission is dominant, then the effective size\nof the cultural trait population will be small (i.e. the trait will originate\nin only one or a small number of individuals), allowing other non-selective\nprocesses, such as cultural drift, to become important [20,63].\n\nChanging structures of social interaction may also change how transmission\nbiases scale up to produce low fertility patterns at the- population level.\nNewson and colleagues [56,57] argue that modernization is typified by\ndeclines in the frequency of kin interactions, owing to a smaller proportion\nand influence of kin in social networks. They argue that a teaching bias\npredisposes individuals to communicate slightly more pro-natal information to\nkin than to non-kin, such that kin communications will tend to maximize\ninclusive fitness [57]. In theory, a weak teaching bias combined with natural\nselection can maintain high-fertility norms in a population, if social\nnetworks are dense with kin [57]. Economic modernization disrupts these\nconditions, introducing more interactions with non-kin via migration,\neducation and working environments. Over time, incremental changes in the\nfrequency of kin interactions may allow the emergence of population-level\nreproductive norms that are less pro-natal.\n\nSuch group-level characteristics can feed back to influence individual\nbehaviour. Cultural niche construction models are one way to address these\nkinds of interactions [23]. These examine how the distribution of one cultural\ntrait, such as a preference for education, can transform both the modes and\nrates by which secondary cultural traits are spread in the population [5860].\nDifferent cultural backgrounds or niches then determine the evolutionary\ndynamics of information transmission. Different channels of transmission (i.e.\nhorizontal and oblique versus purely vertical) can become more important\ndepending on whether the trait being transmitted has a life cycle that (i)\nmakes it more relevant at different life-history stages or (ii) makes non-\nparental social models particularly salient in transmitting it [21]. For\nillustration, assume that women initially inherit reproductive norms from\ntheir mothers, via vertical transmission. Some values, like those affecting\ncontraceptive behaviour, will not be important until the woman reaches\nmaturity. At that point, a wider array of social interactions exposes women to\nthe reproductive norms of lateral kin and non-kin in their social environment,\nincreasing the amount of information relevant to reproduction that is\nobliquely and horizontally transmitted.\n\nRapid ecological change can exacerbate these differences. In slowly changing\ncontexts, and especially in relatively closed social groups, reproductive\nnorms may be less variable and information from different people fairly\nconsistent (i.e. the entire population is at a cultural equilibrium). Old\norder Anabaptists and other culturally isolated groups, who often have high\nfertility even when living within low fertility societies such as the USA, are\nprime examples [35]. When change is relatively rapid, as during economic\nmodernization, parental information about reproduction may be out of date by\nthe time a women reaches maturity, further enhancing the salience of\ninformation from conspecifics, locally prestigious and self-similar\nindividuals [62].\n\nIn the first of a series of models, Ihara & Feldman [58] examined how a\nvertically inherited preference for high education affected the percolation of\na low-fertility preference via oblique transmission. They assumed that high\naverage education in a group increases the degree to which traits are\ntransmitted obliquely (e.g. from teachers) compared with vertically (from\nparents). They found that if parents have a slight bias to transmit high-\neducation preferences to their childrenperhaps because they want to invest in\nchildren's education, transmit heritable wealth or have high-status\nthemselvesthen oblique transmission can hitchhike on this process to spread\nsmall family size norms faster than could vertical transmission alone. Kendal\n_et al_. [59] similarly assumed that high average education accelerates the\nhorizontal transmission of preferences for contraceptive use. They examined\nhow horizontal transmission interacts with conformity to a high-fertility norm\nand with natural selection pressure against low fertility. Their model shows\nthat low fertility preferences can invade the population even if natural\nselection favouring high fertility is strong, as long as horizontal\ntransmission is prevalent and conformity bias is low. The higher the frequency\nof parents preferring to transmit values about education, and thus the higher\nmean education in the offspring generation, the easier this invasion is, and\nthe lower the amount of horizontal transmission needed to get the process\ngoing [59].\n\nBorenstein _et al_. [60] extended this framework to examine how these\ntransmission dynamics play out in a network of subpopulations. They found that\nindividuals living in groups with lower average education could still be\ninfluenced by the spread of low-fertility preferences in other parts of the\npopulation. Interactions between groups can expose people to low-fertility\nnorms at a lower level of education than would be expected if that group were\nin isolation. This kind of effect could help explain not only why fertility\ndecline begins in more educated groups first, but also why it spreads to\ndifferent, neighbouring groups at increasingly lower levels of economic\ndevelopment, especially when they share a linguistic, ethnic or religious\naffiliation that makes social interaction outside the group more likely\n[6,60,82]. A general pattern emerging from these models is a time lag between\nmortality and fertility reduction that is consistent with the empirical record\n[6] (under the reasonable assumption that education affects individual\nmortality profiles). These time lags depend critically on how average\neducation affects the rate of cultural transmission; they do not emerge when\naverage education is not allowed to play this role [59].\n\nA few models have begun to tackle how age-specific learning patterns influence\nboth cultural transmission dynamics and the demographic (age) structure of a\npopulation [20,61,83]. The idea here is that if learning is age-structured or\nhas a life cycle (as outlined above), there is a greater chance that an\nindividual will encounter a horizontally or obliquely transmitted trait as\nthey age. Fogarty _et al._ [61] showed that if different modes of transmission\nmatter for different age-groups, then low fertility values can simultaneously\nspread quickly in a population and change the population structure via their\neffects on reproduction. Their model predicts that where horizontal\ntransmission is constrained, fertility declines driven by the spread of\ncultural norms will not occur.\n\n#### (c) Maintenance\n\nOther models have examined how low fertility could be maintained over the\nlong-run ([68], see also [69,70]). Kolk _et al_. [68] predict that low\nfertility is unsustainable unless there is a continuously high rate of\ncultural innovation in lifestyles promoting small families. They distinguish\nbetween lifestyle preferences' (inherited preferences for low or high\nfertility) and actual lifestyles themselves (i.e. adoption of a high- or\nlow-fertility outcome). Under the assumption that a latent preference for low\nfertility must exist in part of the population (the initial conditions assume\nthat 80% of the population has this preference), they develop two models to\nexamine how vertically transmitted reproductive preferences fare against a\nbias to adopt low-fertility behaviours observed in other peers (including\nparents). The central mechanism is the intergenerational correlation between\nparents' and children's preferences and outcomes. Their first model predicts\nthat under high-fidelity vertical transmission, high-fertility preferences and\nbehaviours will inevitably dominate the population. This happens through\neffects on both fertility and intergenerational correlations. As low fertility\ninitially spreads, variation in intergenerational correlations grows, but they\nbecome less varied again as high-fertility behaviours take over, i.e. natural\nselection kicks in. Their second model examines what happens when assumptions\nabout the fidelity of vertical transmission are relaxed and individuals can\nhave multiple preferences influencing fertility. This effectively increases\nthe rate of lifestyle innovation, dampening the tendency for high-fertility\npreferences to become dominant, and because individuals can now have\npreferences that are different from their parents, low-fertility lifestyles\ncan persist [68].\n\n### 4\\. Conceptual gaps and overlaps\n\nA major roadblock to successfully integrating the CE and HBE frameworks is the\nfact that different evolutionary models often generate the same empirical\npredictions at the individual level, making competing hypotheses difficult to\nidentify [8,11], and their different epistemological contributions unclear.\nThe following examples highlight some aspects of this problem.\n\n#### (a) Social learning as a proximate mechanism\n\nAn influential explanation of demographic transition is that the real or\nperceived costs of children increase as living standards go up, with the\nopportunity costs to reproduction becoming disproportionately large for the\nwealthy and highly educated members of a population [8,10,84]. Individual\nfertility reductions, under this essentially economic approach, can be\ninterpreted as best responses to investment or information constraints [17],\nwith social learning acting as a proximate, but not an alternative, causal\nmechanism. Social learning strategies evolved to generate adaptive fit between\nenvironment and behaviour; they do not in and of themselves affect the broader\nreproductive strategy. But it is new information that can lead to behaviour\nchange, not just the fact that we have social learning mechanisms. Cultural\nnorms and values are themselves evolving, and not necessarily in tandem with\nreproductive success. While humans have been social learners at a large scale\nfor a very long time, some institutional changes like mass communication and\neducation systems have profound effects on the scale and speed of information\npassing (often horizontally) through populations. Socially, spatially,\nculturally and demographically structured interactions additionally affect\nwhat goes into our decision-making mechanisms. Perceptions about the marginal\ngains from embodied capital investment and about greater opportunity costs are\nsubject to these constraints. Of course, some opportunity costs may be more\nfixed than others, trade-offs between time spent on childbearing and\neducation/work being one example. In explaining why trade-offs are negotiated\nin the particular ways they are, we should not side-step the issue that\neducational and economic institutions are themselves socially constructed and\ncoevolving entities, not wholly exogenous constraints on reproduction.\n\n#### (b) The meaning of education\n\nEducation is usually conceptualized as an economic indicator or as a proxy for\nembodied capital [10,12,73]. But education also exposes individuals to new\nideas via other individuals, mass media and other sources of information,\nwhich effectively changes the entire landscape of options available to\nreproducing women. It potentially improves the fidelity and quality of the\ninformation received, reducing uncertainty in decision-making. Relatively\nlittle is known about how exactly education affects fertility, and the causal\npathways will be different in different contexts [85]. This ambiguity is\ncompounded at higher levels of aggregation, where education can proxy anything\nfrom the spatial distribution of economic development to higher rates of\nhorizontal transmission. It is not enough to know that education correlates\nnegatively with fertility at both a micro and a macro level. To generate\ncausal hypotheses of fertility decline, we also need to know how its effects\nare determined, why humans have decided to value education as a social as well\nas an economic good, and how, when measured at different levels of\naggregation, education influences all members of a population, not just the\neducated ones [15].\n\n#### (c) Prestige and competition\n\nPrestige- or success-biases are entirely compatible with an approach to\nfertility decline that emphasizes inter-individual competition for parental\ninvestment payoffs. If individuals compete to obtain wealth or status, and\nthese have fitness-relevant outcomes (which they have had for most of human\nhistory and in most pre-transition societies), then the behaviour of wealthy,\nhigh-quality parents is a useful cue to the benefits of reproductive control.\nIt is therefore difficult to say whether the imitation of successful\nindividuals is an indirect bias, in the sense that individuals copy other\nbehaviours and end up with low fertility as a by-product, or a direct bias,\nwhere individuals adopt low fertility strategically. This makes it hard to\ndistinguish them as alternative causal pathways.\n\n#### (d) Group-level effects\n\nCE processes are multi-level phenomena. Yet, it is hard to know whether\ndifferences between particular levels of aggregation represent cultural or\necological determinants, and they can often be interpreted both ways. Are\ngroup-level effects on fertility indicative of cultural processes or\naggregations of individual decisions in relation to some unobserved variable?\nIdentification, selection and omitted variable problems are well known in\neconomics and sociology [86] and are especially difficult to address when\ncultural and economic changes are correlated, as during demographic\ntransitions. Theoretical refinements on the causal mechanisms of fertility\ndecline as well as inventive data collection and analysis strategies will be\nneeded to continue disentangling these effects.\n\nOf course, the appropriate definition of a group is not obvious, and no one\nsocial grouping (ego-networks, households, kinship groups, villages, social\nstrata, ethnic, linguistic or religious groups) will be appropriate for all\ndomains of social behaviour. Research focusing on differences and similarities\nbetween predictors at different levels of social hierarchies [28,87] will be\nincreasingly important for such development.\n\n#### (e) Over-simplified assumptions?\n\nTheoretical models of fertility decline usually assume undifferentiated\nindividuals with equal opportunities to access information, perfect sampling\nof available cultural learning models and freedom to enact their reproductive\npreferences. CE models do not often include individual resource constraints on\nreproductive options, a hallmark of HBE, even though diffusion dynamics are\nsensitive to individual wealth or income heterogeneity [88], population sub-\nstructure [89] and task structure [90].\n\nCE models should also be tempered by the understanding that kin regularly have\nreproductive conflicts of interest and may wield significant power over\nreproductive-aged women. Dichotomies between kin and non-kin, implying broadly\npro-natal outcomes of kin interactions, neglect the empirical evidence that\nkin effects on fertility are highly varied [91]. On the other hand, theorizing\nabout kin conflict in HBE could be expanded to include how individuals\nnegotiate the normative expectations of their kinship groups. CE dynamics may\nlead individuals to reject familial norms encouraging higher fertility,\ngenerating intergenerational conflict through alternative causal pathways to\nthose that are typically considered in HBE.\n\nCE models typically require that high-status individuals have lower fertility\nin order to obtain their results [21,5860,68]. This one simplifying\nassumption begs the question: why do high-status individuals reduce fertility\nin the first place? Given the aspect of fertility decline being studied here\n(i.e. spread rather than origins), this assumption seems justified, and we\nshould not expect all models to address all phases of the transition. However,\nCE should expand its focus to also address these origin-type questions. In\nprinciple, social learning can drive traits to fixation both when they are\nrare (via novelty-biases) and once they exist at an appreciable frequency, but\nwe need to know how these preferences get to those frequencies and if we can\ndistinguish them from asocial learning strategies.\n\n#### (f) Contraceptive use and uptake\n\nContraceptive use could represent strategic parental investment in the number\nor quality of children. But it could also represent a _dis_ investment in\nreproduction in favour of other aims; self-fulfillment via education, work or\nsome other measure of cultural success. For HBE, decisions to postpone, space\nor stop reproduction are sensitively tuned to environmental and social cues\nindicating optimal behaviour in a particular context, including cues of\nfecundability, mortality and resource availability throughout the life-course\n[4,92] and the support or disapproval of other kin [93,94]. Contraceptive use\ncan be consistent with both high and low fertility, and users often have\nhigher fertility than non-users in sub-Saharan Africa [93,95]. The focus on\nexamining how frequencies of contraceptive behaviour change in CE research\ndoes not address the varying ways that contraceptives are used. CE also makes\nthe problematic assumption that contraceptive use is synonymous with low-\nfertility preferences. This exposes a critical difference between\ncontraceptive use as a proxy for low-fertility norms, subject to reproductive\ncosts and benefits, and the type of method (or cultural variant) that an\nindividual uses, which may diffuse entirely separately and through different\ntransmission channels [28]. More broadly, the almost exclusive focus on the\ndiffusion of modern methods in both sub-fields obscures the fact that (i)\nall populations have probably tried to control their reproduction in some way\n[96], and (ii) natural methods such as _coitus interruptus_ have been and\nremain critical in many fertility declines [28,97].\n\nHBE has been more successful in accounting for the context-specific way that\ncontraceptives are used, but less successful in explaining contraceptive\ndiffusion, with network-based studies equivocal on the importance of social\nlearning [13,28,93]. This raises yet another interpretive issue: should a lack\nof contraceptive clustering, in populations with very few users, be\ninterpreted as evidence that social learning is unimportant? Or is an\nalternative interpretation that strong conformity to pre-existing traditional\nnorms drives these results, especially given evidence that contraceptive\ninformation is widely available [13,93]?\n\n### 5\\. Directions for future research\n\nThese conceptual overlaps suggest that we need to define more parts of the\nsystem of fertility decline to articulate the added value of different\napproaches. This section outlines some suggestions for conceptual development,\nbuilding on the foregoing literature.\n\n#### (a) Origins, spread and maintenance\n\nDistinguishing between the origins, spread and maintenance of low fertility\nmight be useful in defining the contours of different theoretical and\nempirical research programmes, highlighting the kinds of assumptions that\nmodels should make, and the different scales and processes that might matter.\nDoing so clarifies why most empirical work in HBE, focused primarily on the\norigins of low fertility, has been carried out in populations in the early\nstages of demographic transition [9,13,93,98] and perhaps also why evidence\nfor social transmission has been hard to find. Similar work in populations at\nlater stages of the transition has found strong effects consistent with\ncultural transmission models [15,28], further suggesting that predictors, but\nalso processes, will differ depending on the context.\n\n#### (b) Multi-level selection\n\nThe potential role of multi-level or cultural group selection [63] has not yet\nbeen discussed with respect to fertility decline. That is, while maladaptive\nat the individual level, fertility decline may well be adaptive at (multiple)\nlevels beyond the individual. When groups compete, selection can lead some\ngroups to grow while others shrink (or even disappear). Members of the more\nsuccessful group might have better survival and/or higher reproduction rates,\nindividuals might selectively migrate to more attractive groups where they\nperceive life to be better [64], or out-group individuals might adopt\ncharacteristics from a group they regard as more successful. Group-level\ninteractions are needed for a complete specification of the conditions\nfavouring fertility decline because they may help generate new hypotheses,\nboth about the evolution of educational and economic institutions, and the way\nthese change the costs and benefits of reproduction in modernizing\npopulations.\n\nHistorical fertility declines started in the wealthier sub-strata of\ntechnologically advanced populations during the transition from Malthusian\nstagnation to rapid economic growth, and are associated with profound social\nand economic changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution. Feedback\nbetween population density and technological innovation is thought to have\nthen created a niche for education, to sustain subsequent economic growth\n[99]. An important difference between pre- and post-industrialized societies\nis the extent to which our populations are interconnected through labour and\nmigration transfers, innovation and capital, and increasing interdependence in\ninternational trade and supply networks [66]. While migrants have been shown\nto rapidly adapt aspects of their value-systems within a single generation\n[100], whether this extends to reproductive norms requires further study\n[101]. Certainly, low fertility has been shown to help states become more\nwealthy, interconnected and market-oriented [102], generating higher _per\ncapita_ consumption through human capital accumulation. With increasing\ndependence on technology and innovation, countries sharing international\nresearch and development (R&D) and bilateral foreign direct investment are\nmore economically productive than those that do not cooperate in this way\n[103,104]. Technologically advanced countries appear to interactively\ndownregulate each other's fertility rates through competition and cooperation\nfor increased economic productivity [66,105], and international trade also\ndampens fertility rates [106,107]. Fertility reductions cause temporary rises\nin the rate of economic growth via changing age structures and increasing the\nrelative size of the labour force, a phenomenon known as the demographic\ndividend [73,108].\n\nSuch population-level competition and cooperation may create selective\npressure for market-oriented skills and investment in embodied capital. They\ncan also benefit all individuals in a group, not just those who reduce\nfertility, for example by reducing mortality and increasing lifespans (24\nyears have been gained over the past century [102]) as populations develop\nbetter infrastructure [109]. Cultural or economic institutions, such as gender\nnorms restricting women's employment, or structural biases in development\nspending, could cause groups to succeed or fail in this kind of intergroup\ncompetition. Cross-cultural differences in tightness and loosenessfor\nexample, the acceptability of deviations from existing norms, the caution with\nwhich new norms are received and the openness of mass media and information\nflowscould also influence cultural transmission dynamics both within and\nbetween countries [110]. Economically or culturally successful countries may\nbe able to spread their ideals more effectively than less successful ones,\nthrough soft power or other meansindeed a prominent hypothesis in the\ndemography literature is that fertility decline follows the spread of Western\nvalues [111]. Ultimately, the question is whether the benefits accrued from\nthese higher-level dynamics outweigh the fitness costs in terms of individual\nfertility reduction. Multi-level research should be able to address these\nquestions.\n\n#### (c) How does structure affect fertility decline?\n\nSome studies have started to address how demographic and social structure\ncomplicates inferences about the mechanisms of fertility decline. HBEs have\nrecently begun to focus on how competition within, rather than between social\nstrata affects reproduction [43,44,84], with some suggesting that fertility\ndecline may be an example of Simpson's Paradox, where an overall negative\nrelationship between wealth/status and fertility actually masks multiple\nstratified positive relationships [44]. CE approaches can provide additional\ninsight into these questions. For example, we could conceptualize social\nstrata as different groups with essentially different cultural norms.\nImitating the reproductive behaviour of high-status individuals could then be\nregarded as a form of migration to a different group.\n\nCE models have focused on how population-structure, age-structure and network\ncomposition affect the dynamics of cultural transmission [56,60,61]. Future\nwork should try to combine these outlooks. Indeed, we need to know more about\nhow cultural sub-structures, such as ethno-linguistic or religious groups,\nalter both information transmission dynamics and the costs and benefits of\nfertility decline in multicultural populations. In particular, cultural\noutliers such as old order Anabaptists living in the US provide fascinating\ncase studies where cultural norms effectively block reproductive change while\nallowing the selective use of economic innovations from outside the cultural\ngroup.\n\n#### (d) Recent bounce back in fertility rates\n\nHow do the different evolutionary schools of thought interpret the recent\nbounce-back in fertility rates in the most developed countries of the world\n[112]? One demographer has speculated that richer countries may end up with\nhigher fertility than poorer ones in the future [113]. While many demographers\nare sceptical about a return to high fertility, since short-term baby booms in\nthe recent past have not dampened the general trend towards low fertility,\nassuming that this will be a long-term equilibrium state without a strong\ntheoretical grounding may be dubious [114]. HBEs might interpret bounce-back\nas a sign that the adaptive lag in human responses to our radically altered\necological niche is coming to an end, or that, as more people become wealthy\nand educated, the marginal advantages to investment in quality over quantity\nare declining, leading to relaxed reproductive competition and to higher\nfertility. Perhaps natural selection is shaping decision-making psychologies\nright now to explicitly value reproduction over status striving. Cognitive and\nother psychological research on this topic is sorely needed. Perhaps we will\nsoon find the elusive evidence of a long-term fitness benefit, since lineages\nthat reduced fertility most dramatically may gain a fitness advantage in the\nfuture as resources become scarcer and more unequally distributed [48,54]. CEs\ncould argue that the relative stability of developed economies increases the\nbenefits to asocial over social learning, or that social learning is now more\naccurately tracking environmental cues, either of which could de-emphasize\nhorizontal transmission and potentially increase fertility rates. That richer\ncountries may eventually end up with higher fertility than poorer countries\nalso raises the possibility that multi-level selection is important. In the\nhypothetical future where global fertility has converged at or below\nreplacement levels, populations with relatively younger age structures, owing\nto marginally higher fertility, may better compete internationally within\nglobal trade and communication networks.\n\n### 6\\. Conclusion\n\nFertility decline is a difficult moving target, because no two declines are\nthe same and because behaviour change involves multi-level processes and\noften, feedback. A comprehensive evolutionary approach to fertility decline\nmust incorporate insights from CE theory if it is to fully understand this\ntransition process. Doing so requires a greater degree of multi-level thinking\nand a deeper understanding of the proximate mechanisms that are often seen\nas a secondary concern. Mechanistic causal models are needed because theories\nthat are functionally equivalent are not necessarily causally equivalent [41].\nA focus on the ultimate function of behaviour has undoubtedly been successful\nin illuminating a wide array of human behaviours in less- and more-developed\nenvironments and in generating new hypotheses. But a clearer understanding of\nhow individuals go about the business of optimizing fitness, and whether\noptimization is robust to information cascades and multi-level cultural\ndynamics, is needed. A conceptual division between the origin, spread and\nmaintenance of low fertility may be useful in tackling these problems, without\nasserting causal primacy to one level of analysis over another. Multi-level\ncultural selection is an open topic of debate and refinement [38,41,63], and\nresearchers of fertility decline are well placed to contribute to these\nbroader theoretical developments, not least because reproduction is the\nprimary mechanism of biological evolution. Combined with attention to\noverlapping debates in demography, a synthesis of evolutionary frameworks will\nprovide a better understanding than will a focus on one framework alone.\n\n### Competing interests\n\nWe declare we have no competing interests.\n\n### Funding\n\nI thank ANR-Labex IAST for funding.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nI am grateful to all the members of the NESCent working group on Evolutionary\nTheories of the Fertility Transition, as well as Adam Powell, Mary K.
