To date, much of the theoretical work on social learning has been\ndone in isolation of data, and consequently many insights focus on revealing\nthe learning processes or the distributions of cultural variants that are\nexpected to have evolved in human populations. In population genetics, recent\nmethodological advances have allowed a greater understanding of the explicit\ndemographic and/or selection mechanisms that underlie observed allele\nfrequency distributions across the globe, and their change through time. In\nparticular, generative frameworksoften using coalescent-based simulation\ncoupled with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)have provided robust\ninferences on the human past, with no reliance on _a priori_ assumptions of\nequilibrium. Here, we demonstrate the applicability and utility of generative\ninference approaches to the field of cultural evolution. The framework\nadvocated here uses observed population-level frequency data directly to\nestablish the likely presence or absence of particular hypothesized learning\nstrategies. In this context, we discuss the problem of equifinality and argue\nthat, in the light of sparse cultural data and the multiplicity of possible\nsocial learning processes, the exclusion of those processes inconsistent with\nthe observed data might be the most instructive outcome. Finally, we summarize\nthe findings of generative inference approaches applied to a number of case\nstudies.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue Bridging cultural gaps:\ninterdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution.\n\n### 1\\. Introduction\n\nUnderstanding how human populations acquire, and use, social information is\none of the central challenges of cultural evolution and the focus of a highly\nactive, interdisciplinary debate [1]. Social learning, or cultural\ntransmission, is defined as learning that is facilitated by observations of,\nor interactions with, another individual or their cultural products [2,3]. It\nsupports the spread of adaptive information, accumulated over generations\n[46], yet also bears the risk of transmitting outdated, misleading or\ninappropriate information, especially in changing environmental conditions\n[7]. But there is no unique way in which social information can be acquired;\nin fact, a large number of social learning processes have been identified in\nthe literature (e.g. [5,6,8]). Research aimed at identifying learning\nprocesses in human populations can be roughly divided into two groups:\nexperimental laboratory-based and theoretical modelling-based approaches.\nLaboratory-based experiments, in particular microsocieties (e.g. [912]) and\ndiffusion chain experiments (e.g. [1316]), have focused on uncovering the\nvariety and subtlety of human social learning strategies, providing a powerful\nframework for studying cultural evolution empirically (see [1,17] for\ncomprehensive review).\n\nIn the following, we focus on theoretical modelling-based approaches. These\nevolutionary models of learning have mainly focused on understanding which\nindividual and social learning strategies are expected to have to evolved in\nspatially and temporally changing environments (see [18] for a comprehensive\nreview of this literature). These models provided an elegant characterization\nof the long-term outcomes of evolution through natural selection, as well as\ntheir associated evolutionary trajectories, and therefore produce predictions\nof which learning processes are expected to be present in the population.\n\nHowever, in order to verify those predictions, social learning processes would\nneed to be observed directly so that fine-grained individual-level data\ndetailing who learns from whom can be generated. But outside of controlled\nexperimental conditions, large longitudinal datasets of this kind are\ndifficult to obtain, especially in historical or anthropological contexts\n(e.g. [19], but see [20,21] for two cultural evolutionary case studies and\n[22] for a research program dedicated to addressing this issue). This is not\nto say that no such data exist, but in many case studies of interest the\navailable data are in the form of frequencies of different variants of a\ncultural trait in the population at one or several points in time. While many\nmodern datasets possess a rich temporal resolution (e.g. those describing the\nchoice of first names in modern populations, which record the number of\ninstances of a specific name each year), prehistoric or anthropological\ndatasetsthe focus of this papertypically describe the frequencies of\ndifferent cultural variants in sparse samples from the whole population.\n\nSo if we want to infer social learning processes from available data, we face\na classical inverse problem: we can only observe aggregated, population-level\nfrequency data but aim at identifying the underlying individual-level learning\nprocesses that gave rise to them. Recent approaches to address this inverse\nproblem have focused on, among other things: the shape of adoption curves\n(e.g. [4,23,24]); the comparison between observed levels of cultural diversity\nor cultural accumulation and the ones expected under various processes of\nsocial learning (in particular unbiased transmission (or neutral evolution)\n(e.g. [2528])); the shape of rank-abundance distributions (e.g. [2931]); and\nthe comparison between observed turnover rates and the ones expected under\nunbiased transmission (e.g. [32,33]) or phylogenetic analyses (e.g. [34]).\nThis research has clearly shown that robustly inferring the underlying\nprocesses of social learning from population-level frequency data becomes a\nchallenging task, especially in the light of equifinality, i.e. in situations\nwhere various learning processes can result in very similar population-level\ncharacteristics (e.g. [35,36]).\n\nHowever, the inverse problem described above is of course not unique to\ncultural evolution. In fact, other scientific fields have successfully\novercome similar challenges, in particular population genetics, which aims to\nunderstand the evolutionary mechanisms that produced the allele frequency\ndistributions observed both now and in the past. Here, recent developments\nhave provided elegant means for building complex evolutionary models, and\nallowing the application of efficient generative inference frameworks, which\nmade possible the statistical testing of increasingly realistic demographic\nhypotheses. In general, the generative approach proceeds by building a fully\nspecified probabilistic model, in which the hypothesized causal mechanisms are\nexplicitly defined. This model is then used to repeatedly simulate pseudo-\ndatasets under known parameter values, such that their expected distribution\ncan be statistically compared with observed data, through techniques such as\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC). This comparison allows certain\nhypothesized mechanisms to be rejected as inconsistent with the empirical\ndata, and the estimation of model parameters that provide the best fit.\n\nOur goal in this paper is to demonstrate how the generative inference approach\ncan help answer the question of how human populations use social information,\nbased on observable empirical evidence. We note that the general idea of\ngenerative modelling has already been applied to socio-cultural evolution.\nSignificant early examples include Schelling's segregation model [37] and the\ninfluential agent-based economic modelling framework of _Sugarscape_ [38].\nThese approaches and subsequent generalizations (see e.g. [39]) investigated\nthe effects of explicitly defined individual-level causal mechanisms on\npopulation-level outcomes, which could then be compared with observed data.\nWhile one of the major advantages of this line of work is that the complex\nnature of the models considered allowed for more realistic expected outcomes,\nthe principal limitation has been the lack of a robust statistical methodology\ncapable of comparing these outcomes to empirical data. However, careful\napplication of techniques like ABC, as mentioned above, is beginning to remove\nthis limitation to inference (e.g. [40]).\n\nWe believe that the generative inference approach reviewed in this paper may\nlink theoretical and empirical work in cultural evolution closer together by\nproviding a framework that is able to evaluate the consistency between\ndifferent individual-level processes and observed population-level patterns;\nin our case, between different processes of social learning and observed\npatterns of cultural change. Similarly to population genetics, such an\ninference framework consists of building a generative model that establishes a\ncausal link between individual-level learning processes and observable\npopulation-level frequency data that then are evaluated for statistical\nconsistency. The outcome of this approach is not only the identification of\nthe most likely underlying learning process given the empirical data but a\ndescription of the breadth of processes that could have produced these data\nequally well, which in turn can be interpreted as an informal measure of the\nlevel of equifinality. Additionally, the inference framework may provide\ninsight into the temporal and/or spatial resolution of the population-level\nfrequency data that are needed to reliably distinguish between different\nprocesses of social learning (see [41] for a related discussion). In 1a, we\nbriefly review some of the relevant key developments in population genetics,\nbefore exploring the applicability of the generative inference approach to\ncultural frequency data in 2.\n\n#### (a) Population genetics and generative inference\n\nClassical population geneticswith its _prospective_ approach [42]provided\nmany important theoretical insights into how the processes of mutation, drift,\nselection, migration and demographic change may shape the genetic variation\nexpected in a population at equilibrium (e.g. [4345]). But the development of\ncoalescent theory in the early 1980s [46] (see also [4749]) offered an\nalternative _retrospective_ view of genetic evolution, providing a statistical\nmodel for the genealogical relationships between just a sample of individuals\nrather than the entire population. One major advantage of this coalescent\nframework is that, given an explicit model of demographic history and a\nmutation model, it allows for very efficient simulation of geneticor genomic-\nscaledata for an observed sample with no _a priori_ assumption of\nequilibrium. This has proved very useful in inferring population history, and\nwhile there is a wide array of other methodological approaches (e.g. [5055]),\nthe generative approachin which simulated genetic data are statistically\ncompared to the observed datais growing in popularity, with the models of\ndemographic history becoming increasingly complex and realistic (e.g.\n[5658]).\n\nHowever, generative inference crucially relies on the ability to make an\nevaluation of the quality of the model used. Rather than simply rejecting\nthose demographic models or hypotheses that generate genetic variation\ninconsistent with what we observe (as in [59,60]), there exists a large and\ngrowing body of statistical techniques that allow for the explicit comparison\nof competing scenarios and the estimation of their underlying parameters. One\nsuch approach, ABC [61,62], was developed by statistical and population\ngeneticists to circumvent the difficulty, or impossibility, of specifying the\nlikelihood functions for complex models. ABC relies on repeatedly simulating\npseudo-data under an explicitly specified model and, by retaining just those\nparameter values that generate data close to the observed data, allows\nestimation of their posterior distributions (full details are given in 2b). A\nnumber of researchers have used this pairing of coalescent-based simulation\nand ABC to answer diverse questions about human demographic history, from\nearly population differentiation in sub-Saharan Africa [63], to the global\nexpansion of modern humans during the Late Pleistocene [58], to\nhuntergatherer population replacement in Europe [64] and the initial\ncolonization of the Americas [57] at the end of the last Ice Age.\n\n### 2\\. Generative inference for cultural evolution\n\nIn the following, we demonstrate how generative inference procedures can be\nconstructed and used to infer social learning processes from cultural data in\nthe form of time-series detailing the usage or occurrence frequencies of\ndifferent cultural variants. Similar to the population genetic applications,\nthe inference procedure consists of two steps. First, we develop a non-\nequilibrium generative model capturing the main cultural and demographic\ndynamics of the considered system. This model describes the frequency\nevolution of different cultural variants present in a population at given time\npoints under an assumed social learning hypothesis. Second, ABC techniques are\nused to derive conclusions about which (mixtures of) learning strategies are\nconsistent with the observable frequency data and which are not. The aim of\nthis framework is to allow researchers to reverse engineer, which learning\nstrategies are likely to have been used in current or past populations, given\nknowledge of how frequencies have changed over time, independent of optimality\nor equilibrium assumptions. Figure 1 summarizes the steps of the generative\ninference framework described in this section. ****\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of the proposed generative inference\nframework. This non-equilibrium framework requires multiple observation (i.e.\nat least two) of cultural data _D_ ( _t_ _j_ ), in our case population-level\nfrequencies of different cultural variant types, at known times _t_ _j_.\ndenotes the theoretical data produced under the social learning process\ndescribed by .

If the observed data are of a different\nnature, e.g. describing the continuous variation of certain attributes of\ncultural artefacts, such as the dimensions of an arrowhead, then researchers\nhave to first construct a hypothesis about the relationship between temporal\nvariation of the attribute and the social learning processes considered in\norder to apply a similar inference procedure.\n\nIn 2a,b we describe the two steps of the inference framework and discuss in\n2c the theoretical limits to inference; specifically, we ask how much\ninformation about underlying social learning processes we should expect to\ninfer from population-level frequency data of a given temporal resolution. In\n2d(ii) we show how the generative approach has been applied to cultural case\nstudies. Lastly, in 2e we discuss some issues researchers should consider\nbefore applying the proposed, or a similar, inference framework.\n\n#### (a) Generative model\n\nAs mentioned above, the generative model aims at capturing the main cultural\nand demographic dynamics of the cultural system. Importantly, the generative\nmodel has to produce pseudo-datain our case, population-level frequencies of\ndifferent variants of a cultural trait at different points in time conditioned\non the assumed social learning processso that theoretical predictions can be\ncompared to empirical observations. Thereby different learning processes are\nexpressed by different model parameterizations; the model parameters are\ndenoted by __ = ( __ 1, , __ _k_ ) in the following. In other words, the\ngenerative model establishes an explicit causal relationship between the\nassumed processes of social learning defined by __ and observable population-\nlevel patterns of cultural change.\n\nWe note that there are no restrictions on the type of generative model used.\nModels ranging from systems of partial differential equations to agent-based\nsimulations have also been used successfully; in fact, a number of the models\nmentioned in 1 could, with an appropriate choice of generative model,\nfeasibly be adapted for use within this inference framework. As we want to\ngenerate frequency data at different time points, we advocate the use of non-\nequilibrium models, which can also account for temporal changes in demographic\nproperties of the cultural system (e.g. variations in the total size of the\npopulation of cultural variants). This modelling choice aims at reducing the\nrisk of misinterpreting non-equilibrium dynamics as evidence for the presence\nor absence of particular social learning processes (see [65] for a detailed\ndiscussion). For instance, the rejection of the hypothesis of neutral cultural\nevolution, based on empirical data, has usually been interpreted as evidence\nfor the existence of selective biases in the population. But it has been\npointed out that such a rejection can also be indicative of non-equilibrium\ndynamics or simply violations of the inherent assumptions of the neutral model\n(e.g. [28,66]). We note, however, that the relaxing of the equilibrium\nassumption requires accurate knowledge about e.g. the time points at which the\nobserved frequencies are recorded. We return to this issue in 2e.\n\n#### (b) Statistical inference\n\nTo infer which learning strategies are consistent with the observed data we\nwould ideally determine the likelihood function of the generative model.\nHowever, in many cases (if not most in reality) the likelihood functions\ncannot be determined easily. As introduced in 1a, ABC [61,62] was developed\nto circumvent this difficulty. Given observed data _D_ , this likelihood-free\napproach directly approximates the joint posterior density of the model\nparameters _P_ ( __ | _D_ ). It does this through repeatedly simulating data\n_D_  under a generative model with parameter values drawn from their prior\ndistributions _P_ ( __ ). These prior distributions describe the possible\nvalues that the parameter can assume or summarize all prior knowledge\nresearchers may have. Retaining those parameter sets that generate data\nsufficiently close to the observed data _D_ , and rejecting the rest,\nresults in a random sample from the distribution _P_ ( __ | _d_ ( _D_ , _D_\n)  __ ), where _d_ (  ,  ) is a distance metric between the observed and\nsimulated data, and __ is a tolerance level determining the approximation to\nthe true posterior _P_ ( __ | _D_ ). Modal values and credible intervals for\neach model parameter can then be obtained from this approximate joint\nposterior.\n\nDue to the high-dimensionality of most real-world datasets, the data _D_ are\noften reduced to a summary statistic (or a set of summary statistics) _S_ , so\nthat we are really sampling from _P_ ( __ | _d_ ( _S_ , _S_ )  __ ) to\napproximate the posterior _P_ ( __ | _S_ ). The choice of appropriate summary\nstatistics to maximize sufficiency (i.e. such that ) is not straightforward,\nand is an active area of statistical research (e.g. [67] and see also 2e).\nThere have been many extensions to this initial basicand\ninefficientrejection algorithm, including weighting the retained parameter\nsets dependent on their exact distances _d_ (  ,  ) through regression\nmethods (e.g. [61,68]) or increasing the efficiency of sampling from the prior\ndistributions (e.g. [69,70]).\n\nThe output of any ABC procedure is the joint posterior distribution of the\nmodel parameters __ = ( __ 1, , __ _k_ ) (and derived from that the\nmarginal posterior distributions), indicating the range of the parameter space\nthat is able to produce frequency data within a given tolerance level __ of\nthe observed data, and consequently the learning strategies that are\nconsistent with the data. We stress that the obtained posterior distribution\nis only a good approximation of the true, posterior distribution for small\ntolerance levels __. Therefore if the obtained __ is largeand cannot be\nimproved uponthe inferred parameter spaces are likely not meaningful. This\nsituation may point to an inadequacy of the model, and therefore the assumed\nsocial learning processes, to explain the data. The explanatory value of the\nobtained posterior distribution can be investigated by posterior predictive\nchecks [71]. These assess how well the parameter ranges specified by the\nposterior distribution explain the observed data (see [65] for further detail\nand 2d(i)). Additionally, cross validation tests or coverage plots have been\ndeveloped to further investigate the accuracy of the results of the ABC\nanalysis [40,72,73]. In practice, performing ABC analyses has been made\nrelatively straightforward since the release of software such as DIY-ABC [74],\nABCtoolbox [75], and R packages abc [72], abctools [76] and EasyABC [77].\n\nFinally, we note that as well as estimating parameters, ABC has also been used\nto test between multiple competing models, by estimating Bayes factors from\nthe relative proportions of simulations accepted from each model (e.g. [62]).\nWhile it has been shown that this approach is not theoretically justified [78]\nwhen reducing the data _D_ to summary statistics _S_ as owing to the loss of\ninformation this approximation does not necessarily converge on the true Bayes\nfactorsa number of authors have successfully applied various simulation-based\npower analyses to mitigate this problem (see for example [63,64,79]). And more\nrecently another approach utilizing machine learning algorithmsand in\nparticular random forestshas begun to prove successful for complex ABC model\nselection [80,81].\n\n#### (c) Limits to inference\n\nIt is well-known that efforts to understand learning processes based on\npopulation-level data may be confounded by equifinality (e.g. [35,36] for a\nrecent discussion). The inference framework introduced above generates\nposterior distributions of the model parameter describing the learning\nstrategies that are consistent with the observed data. Therefore, the widths\nof these distributions, or their credible intervals, may provide an informal\nmeasure of the level of equifinality [82]. If the posterior distributions are\nnarrow then only a small region of the parameter space is consistent with the\ndata and therefore a large number of learning processes are _not_ able to\nproduce the observed frequency changes. In this case, the data carry a\nrelatively strong signature of the underlying processes of social learning. By\ncontrast, if the distributions are wide, a large region of the parameter space\nis consistent with the data and therefore many social learning processes are\nable to generate very similar population-level frequency patterns.\n\nIn this way the inference framework itself provides a way of exploring the\ninferential limits of population-level data of a given temporal resolution.\nFor this, the generative model is used to simulate frequency data with a\nspecific parameterization __ , i.e. under a _known_ process of social\nlearning. Applying the inference procedure to this data produces posterior\ndistributions, and while we know that the data have been generated with a\nspecific parameter value, these distributions indicate all other values (and\ntherefore learning processes) that could produce the observed frequency\nchanges equally well. Wide posterior distributions then mean that researchers\nshould not expect cultural datawhich is likely to be more noisy compared to\npseudo-data produced by the generative modelwith a similar temporal\nresolution to provide much information about underlying mechanisms.\n\nBut when do we consider a marginal posterior distribution narrow? One\npossibility is to compare the widths of prior and posterior distributions of\nthe parameter in question. As mentioned above, the prior distribution\ndescribes the possible values that the parameter can assume or summarizes all\nprior knowledge researchers may have (see blue, solid line in figure 2 for an\nexample of a uniform, uninformative prior distribution). If the parameter\nrange covered by the posterior distribution is smaller compared to the range\ncovered by the prior distribution (see the red, dashed line in figure 2 as an\nexample) then the inference procedure led to the exclusion of some learning\nhypotheses: social learning processes described by parameter values not\ncovered by the posterior distribution cannot generate theoretical data\nsufficiently close to the observed data and are consequently not considered to\nbe consistent with the observations. Naturally, the smaller the credible\ninterval the more the pool of potential hypotheses can be reduced, and the\nstronger the signature of underlying social learning processes in the observed\npopulation-level data. If, however, the parameter ranges covered by prior and\nposterior distributions are almost identical (see the red, dotted line in\nfigure 2 as an example), then _a priori_ knowledge of the researchers cannot\nbe improved by analysing such data at the given resolution. ****\n\nFigure 2. Blue solid line: uninformative, uniform prior distribution for\nparameter __ 1; red dashed and red dotted lines: potential marginal posterior\ndistributions for __ 1.

In this context, we showed in [83] that we should\nnot expect to be able to distinguish between unbiased transmission and\nmoderately strong frequency-dependent selection based on frequency information\nof a population of cultural variants at two different points in time.\n\n#### (d) Application to studies of cultural evolution\n\n##### (i) Cultural change in the linearbandkeramik (LBK) period\n\nTo demonstrate the applicability and utility of the generative inference\nframework described above, we summarize in the following the analysis of a\ncultural dataset from the earliest-known farming population in Central Europe,\nthe so-called linearbandkeramik (LBK) from approximately 75007000 years ago\n(see [84] for the complete analysis). The dataset records the frequencies of\ndifferent types of decorated vessels at seven different points in time,\ndenoted by _t_ _j_ , _j_ = 1,  , 7 defining six phases of cultural change\nthat vary in duration. The aim of this study was to explore whether observed\nfrequency changes in different types of pottery between the beginning and the\nend of each of the six phases are consistent with a specific hypothesis about\nthe underlying social learning processes, in particular unbiased transmission,\nfrequency-dependent selection and pro-novelty selection. For the sake of\nbrevity, we consider in the following unbiased and frequency-dependent\nselection only.\n\nThe first step of the inference framework is the development of the\n_generative model_. To make use of all available archaeological information,\nwe used a simulation approach that accounted for the fact that the observed\nfrequencies describe a sample and not the population of pottery types.\nStarting from observed data, the absolute frequencies _D_ ( _t_ _j_ ) = [ _n_\n1, , _n_ _k_ ] of _k_ different variant types in the sample of size _n_ ( _t_\n_j_ ) at the beginning of the phase, _t_ _j_ , we generated a population of\ncultural variants **P** ( _t_ _j_ ) = [ _R_ 1, , _R_ _k_ , _R_ _k_ +1] from\nwhich the sample could have been drawn at random using the Dirichlet\ndistribution approach [71]. The variables _R_ _i_ represent the absolute\nfrequency of variant type _i_ in the population. Importantly, the population\nconsists of _k_ \\+ 1 variant types, where the type _k_ \\+ 1 contains all\nvariants of types not observed in the sample at _t_ _j_.\n\nBased on this population **P** ( _t_ _j_ ) = [ _R_ 1,  , _R_ _k_ , _R_ _k_\n+1] and an estimate of the population size _N_ ( _t_ _j_ ) at time _t_ _j_ (if\nno other information is available the population size _N_ ( _t_ _j_ ) at time\n_t_ _j_ is inferred from the size of the sample at this time), we generated\npopulation-level frequencies of the _k_ \\+ 1 variant types conditioned on a\nspecific process of social learning at each time step _t_ = 1,  , _t_ _j_ +1\n _t_ _j_. For that, we assumed that in each time step a fraction _r_ of the\npopulation of cultural variants is removed and new variants are subsequently\nadded (in this way the framework can accommodate temporal changes in\npopulation size). While the removal process is random, the replacement process\nis defined by the assumed process of social learning. In detail, a variant\ntype _i_ , _i_ = 1,  , _k_ is chosen to be added to the population according\nto the probability\n\n2.1\n\nwhere _N_ ( _t_ ) denotes the population size at time _t_ , _N_ _i_ ( _t_ ) is\nthe number of variants of type _i_ , _u_ is the total number of variants\nremoved at this time step, _u_ _i_ is the number of variants removed of type\n_i_ , _b_ freq controls the strength of frequency-dependent selection and  is\nthe number of variant types present at time _t_. Importantly, choosing _b_\nfreq = 0 in equation (2.1) models unbiased transmission, whereas _b_ freq > 0\ndescribes the selective advantage for high-frequency variant types and _b_\nfreq > 0 for low-frequency types. Further, the variable __ defines the\nprobability with which a novel variant type not previously seen in the\npopulation is introduced into the system. A similar probability as in equation\n(2.1) is defined for variant type _k_ \\+ 1, containing all variant types not\nobserved in the sample at _t_ 1 and, per definition, all subsequent\ninnovations.\n\nLastly, to generate theoretical samples at the end of the phase _t_ _j_ +1, we\nrandomly drew _n_ ( _t_ _j_ +1) cultural variants from the (theoretical)\npopulations **P** ( _t_ _j_ \\+ _t_ ), _t_ = 1,  , _t_ _j_ +1  _t_ _j_.\n\nIn summary, the output of this framework is sample frequencies of the variant\ntypes that were present at the beginning of the phase, _t_ _j_ , and an\nadditional type containing all unobserved variants at the end of the phase,\n_t_ _j_ +1, conditioned on the social learning process specified by the\nparameter _b_ freq in equation (2.1). which controls the strength of the\nfrequency-dependent selection.\n\nTo infer the learning processes consistent with the observed changes in\nfrequency between the beginning and the end of the phases, we applied an ABC\nprocedurespecifically SMC ABC (e.g. [70])and determined the joint posterior\ndistributions of ( _b_ freq, _r_ ). The replacement fraction _r_ cannot be\nestimated from external sources and therefore has to be inferred from the data\nas well. Thereby the comparison between empirical and theoretical patterns was\nbased on the absolute difference of the theoretical and observed frequencies\nof the _k_ variant types present at the beginning of the simulation.\nAdditionally, we required the same number of initially present variant types\nto have gone extinct at the end of the phase. The general scheme of the\nproposed generative inference framework is illustrated in figure 3. ****\n\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of the proposed inference framework. As\nprocesses of social learning act on the population-level (as opposed to the\nsample-level), we generate population distributions from which the observed\nsample of cultural variants at the beginning of the phase, _t_ 1, could have\nbeen drawn at random using the Dirichlet distribution approach. Subsequently,\nwe transform these populations over time until the end of the phase, _t_ 2,\nconditioned on the assumed social learning process. To obtain theoretical\nsamples at time _t_ 2 that can be compared to the observed sample we randomly\nselect cultural variants from the generated populations between _t_ 1 and _t_\n2.

In fact, the credible intervals of all six marginal posterior distributions for _b_ freq contained the value 0, which means that unbiased transmission cannot be excluded as a potential explanation of the data by this analysis (see figure 4 _a,b_ for an example);\n\n  * (ii) frequency-dependent selection and unbiased transmission may not be the best model to explain the observed data as the achieved tolerance levels (i.e. the distance, between empirical and observed patterns) of the ABC analysis were relatively large.\n\nPoint (ii) suggests that the social learning hypotheses considered are not\nconsistent with the data, which requires a re-evaluation of the generative\nmodel. Indeed, we showed in [84] that pro-novelty selection, which captures\nthe preference for young, or recently introduced, cultural variant types, is\nable to replicate the observed frequency changes between the different phases\nand is therefore _a possible_ explanation of the data. ****\n\nFigure 4.

To perform this, we sampled values of the model parameters from the\njoint posterior distribution, inserted these into the generative model and\nproduced theoretical frequencies at the end of each phase. Repeating this\nprocedure generated theoretical expectations of the frequency ranges for each\nindividual variant type based on the joint posterior distribution. The\ncomparison of the observed frequencies of each variant type with these\nfrequency ranges allowed the explanatory power of the derived posterior\ndistribution to be assessed. If observations are outside the theoretical\nexpectations then the inferred social learning processes cannot replicate all\naspects of the dynamic of cultural change, indicating a mismatch between\ntheory and data. This analysis also has the potential to reveal single variant\ntypes whose temporal frequency patterns deviate from the general population\ntrend (see [65] for more details). Applying the posterior predictive check to\nthe case study showed that a number of observations were outside their\n(theoretical) frequency ranges as determined by the joint posterior\ndistributions (see figure 4 _c_ for an example).\n\n##### (ii) Further applications\n\nIn the last section, we demonstrated the application of a generative inference\nframework to a specific archaeological dataset. Traditionally, Bayesian\ninference in archaeology has been largely limited to age estimation via14C\nanalyses (e.g. [85,86]), but recently the scope of inference techniques has\nbeen vastly broadened, with ABC approaches enjoying increasing popularity\n(e.g. [65,82,8790]). In one of the first archaeological applications, Crema\n_et al._ [87] studied frequency changes of weaponry types in the Jura region\nof southeast France. The dataset comprises arrowheads of 20 types attributed\nto 9 chronologically distinct phases. The aim of this study was to analyse\nwhether the temporal frequency change of the different arrowhead types\ncontained evidence for, or against, unbiased transmission or frequency-\ndependent selection. Using an agent-based simulation as their generative\nmodel, the authors produced frequency change patterns under different\nhypotheses of social learning and under the assumption that the cultural\nsystem is at equilibrium. They compared these theoretical patterns to the\nobserved data by measuring the dissimilarity between assemblages. Applying an\nABC model selection framework, they concluded that both unbiased transmission\nand negative-frequency dependent selection could have generated the observed\nfrequency differences within the phases and therefore excluded positive-\nfrequency dependent selection as a possible mechanism of cultural evolution.\n\nBut ABC frameworks have not been exclusively used to infer underlying social\nlearning strategies. Pori & Nikoli [88] analysed the demographic properties\nof the MesolithicNeolithic transition in the Central Balkan region, in\nparticular growth rates and population size estimates for the Lepenski Vir\npopulation. Their model generated the expected number of accumulated houses\nfor a large range of demographic scenarios which could then be compared to\nthat observed in the archaeological record. The analysis revealed higher\ninitial growth rates compared to other populations undergoing the Neolithic\ndemographic transition and an increase in population size over time.\n\nIn order to highlight the breadth of questions that can be addressed within a\ngenerative inference framework we outline two further applications, one to\nhistorical studies (a field with no strong tradition of quantitative\ntreatments) and to linguistics. Rubio-Campillo [91] investigated the evolution\nof combat. He explored the validity of different versions of Lanchester's law\npredicting the causalities of two enemy forces engaged in a land battle, with\na dataset comprising the total number of combatants and causalities from 1080\nland battles spanning from the middle of the seventeenth to the beginning of\nthe twentieth century. The three most common formulations of Lanchester's law\n(linear, squared and logarithmic) can be operationalized using difference\nequations, and iterating these until one of the forces has suffered as many\ncausalities as recorded in the historical record allowed for the comparison\nbetween theoretical and observed data. Besides confirming well-known results,\nthe ABC framework pointed to a gradual decrease in the relevance of individual\nfighting abilities, suggesting that the plausibility of the models is not\nconstant over the different periods.\n\nLastly, Thouzeau _et al._ [81] investigated the coevolution between genes and\nlanguages at a regional scale. They simulated population genetic and cognate\ndata under various historical models encompassing divergences and multiple\nborrowings and admixture events between linguistic groups. They applied an ABC\nframework using linguistic and genetic data from across Central Asia, and were\nable to reconstruct the partly differing evolutionary scenarios underlying\nlinguistic and genetic differentiation in the region.\n\n#### (e) Cautionary notes\n\nNaturally, the application of the generative inference framework presented\nhere has to proceed with caution. It is, after all, an analysis based on an\nunderlying model of cultural change. If this model does not capture the main\ncultural and demographic processes contributing to the observed temporal\nfrequency changes, the inferences obtained will likely be misleading. In the\nfollowing, we outline some issues researchers should consider before applying\nthis, or a similar, inference framework.\n\nIn this paper, we advocate the use of non-equilibrium frameworks. While this\nmodelling choice allows us to include knowledge about, for example, temporal\nchanges in demographic properties and to initialize the model with observed\nvariant frequencies, it also introduces a time-dependency. The inference\nframework evaluates whether frequency changes between different time points\nare consistent with the changes expected under a specific learning process\n(instead of evaluating whether statistics such as the level of cultural\ndiversity at each point time are consistent with the equilibrium diversity\nprediction) and therefore misspecifications of time points and consequently\nthe duration of the period over which the frequency changes are measured can\nproduce erroneous theoretical expectations. Crema _et al._ [65] argue that the\nequilibrium assumption should serve as a hypothesis to be tested, rather than\nsimply held _a priori_. They applied equilibrium and non-equilibrium versions\nof the generative model of cultural change to a dataset similar to the one\ndescribed in 2d(i). They concluded that the cultural system was likely not at\nequilibrium and found hints for shifts between negative and positive\nfrequency-dependent selection for different phases of the archaeological\nrecord.\n\nIn the archaeological case study described in 2d(i), the temporal change in\npopulation size between the beginning and the end of each archaeological phase\nhas been inferred from the change in sample size, and any increase or decrease\nwas assumed to occur in a linear fashion over the relevant time interval.\nWhile the assumption of linear change seems plausible, especially in the\nabsence of other information, drastic, unobserved demographic events such as\npopulation bottlenecks may be an alternative scenario. Similar to the\ndiscussion about equilibrium versus non-equilibrium models, such hidden\ndemographic events have the potential to influence the dynamic of cultural\nchange (e.g. [92]). As they are not included in the generative model, their\ninfluences may be mistakenly attributed to social learning processes that are\nable to produce a similar effect at the population level. But this potential\npitfall is also itself amenable to testing with the generative inference\nframework. Researchers can at least evaluate the extent to which posterior\ndistributions change when assuming a population bottleneck between the\nbeginning and the end of the phase.\n\nThe accuracy of ABC inference depends partly on how the difference between\nobserved and simulated data is calculated and on the achieved tolerance level.\nCalculating the difference based on summary statistics _S_ instead of the full\ndata _D_ results in discarding likely useful information [93]. If a summary\nstatistic (or set of) is not sufficientas is generally the case in\npracticethe resulting posterior distribution will not be equal to that\ncomputed with the full data [94] (see also [93] for a review of strategies\ndealing with this issue). While the impact of using insufficient statistics on\ninference results can be mitigated by careful application, we note that by\nusing the actual frequencies for calculating the difference between observed\nand simulated data this problem is circumvented entirely. Further, any\nposterior distribution with large tolerance levels does not approximate the\ntrue posterior distribution and should be treated with caution. In this\ncase, the generative model may not produce data that are sufficiently close to\nthe observed data. Additional procedures such as posterior predictive checks,\ncross validation tests or coverage plots offer additional insights into the\naccuracy of the inference results.\n\nLastly, we point to the relationship between data quality or completeness and\ninferential accuracy. A recent study [31] revealed the importance of rare\nvariants for inferring underlying processes. Using the progeny distribution\n(which records the frequencies of cultural variant types that produce _k_ new\nvariants over a fixed period of time) as a statistic, the authors showed that\nanalyses based on only the most popular variants, as is often necessarily the\ncase in cultural evolutionary studies, can provide misleading evidence for\nunderlying transmission hypotheses. Especially in archaeological case studies,\nthe observed frequencies describe the composition of often relatively small\nsamples of cultural variants, and consequently rare variant types are likely\n_not_ sampled and therefore absent from the data. Even though statistical\ntechniques such as the Dirichlet distribution approach mentioned in 2d(i) are\navailable, the number of rare variant types, i.e. types that are not contained\nin the observed sample, is likely to be misspecified (e.g. [95]) and future\nwork is needed to understand the influence of missing data on the accuracy of\nthe generative inference frameworks presented in this paper.\n\n### 3\\. Conclusion\n\nRelatively recent developments in population geneticsnamely coalescent\nmodelling and ABChave made generative inference possible, and shown it to be\na powerful inferential framework for understanding the human past (e.g.\n[57,58,63,64]). Cultural evolutionary theory has been greatly advanced by\nadopting concepts and modelling paradigms originating in population genetics.\nIn this spirit, the aim of this paper was to demonstrate how analogous\ngenerative inference frameworks can be applied to cultural frequency data,\npotentially allowing us to close the gap between theoretical modelling work\nand empirical work in cultural evolution.\n\nIn particular, we focused on the topic of inferring how human populations use\nsocial information based on the available empirical evidence. In many case\nstudies of interest, the available data are in the form of frequencies of\ndifferent variants of a cultural trait in the population at one or several\npoints in time, which means that we face a classical inverse problem.\nNaturally, attempting to address this problem leads to the question of how\nmuch information about underlying processes of social learning can in fact be\nextracted from cultural frequency data of a given resolution. The framework\noutlined here allows us to address this equifinality problem. At the heart of\nthis framework is a generative model, which captures the main cultural and\ndemographic properties of the system considered. As noted, there are no\nrestrictions on the type of model used, with the one described in 2d(i)\nsimply an example tailored specifically to the observed population-level\nfrequency data. Whatever their form, these models establish a causal link\nbetween model parameters controlling the strengths of underlying evolutionary\nprocesses and observable population-level patterns; in our case, between\nparameters controlling the strengths of social learning processes and\npopulation-level frequencies of cultural variant types. Bayesian inference\ntechniques, such as ABC, can then evaluate whether this specific process of\nsocial learning is able to produce frequency patterns consistent with the\nobserved ones.\n\nThe outcome of this inference approach is posterior distributions of the model\nparameters describing the learning processes that are consistent with the\nobserved data. As discussed in 2e, while there are a number of important\nfactors potentially influencing the accuracy of the analysis to consider, the\nwidths of the posterior distributions may be indicative of the amount of\ninformation about the underlying social learning processes contained in the\ndata. Narrow posterior distributions indicate that the data carry a relatively\nstrong signature of these processes, while wider distributions suggest that\nthe data are largely uninformative or that the models considered do not\nprovide an adequate description of the cultural system. Therefore, this\napproach does not only allow for the identification of the most likely\nunderlying learning process given the empirical data, but also for a\ndescription of the breadth of processes that could have produced the these\ndata equally well.\n\nRevealing the presence of equifinality may appear to be a negative result, but\nwe stress that one should not expect a unique mapping between (sparse)\npopulation-level frequency data and underlying processes of cultural evolution\n[4,36]. Nevertheless, the analysis of such data will help in excluding social\nlearning processes that could not have produced the observed data. In this way\ninference frameworks will lead to a reduction in the pool of potential\nhypotheses (even though the level of reduction might vary from case study to\ncase study) and to an understanding of which kinds of scientific questions can\nbe answered by which kinds of data. Additionally, we note that generative\ninference frameworks inform about the consistency of a limited set of possible\nunderlying mechanisms with the data while not excluding the possibility that\nother mechanisms may be consistent as well. However, this should not\nnecessarily be seen as a weakness, and as pointed out by Csillry _et al._\n[93, p. 413], in reality scientific arguments often revolve around a limited\nnumber of hypotheses or scenarios without the need to consider an infinite set\nof alternative models. Models can always be improved and refined by other\nauthors, allowing an open discussion that can greatly increase our\nunderstanding of the problem being studied.\n\nUndoubtedly, more research is needed to further develop and improve the\nstatistical tools and to explore the influence of e.g. unobserved changes in\nthe demographic properties of the system considered or of the quality of the\nobserved data on the accuracy of generative inference frameworks, but we\nbelieve this is an exciting and promising new direction in cultural evolution\nthat has already begun to produce interesting results.\n\n### Data accessibility\n\nThis article has no additional data.\n\n### Competing interests\n\nWe declare we have no competing interests.\n\n### Funding\n\nNo funding has been received for this article.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Nicole Creanza, Oren Kolodny and Mark Feldman for inviting us to\ncontribute to this special issue.
