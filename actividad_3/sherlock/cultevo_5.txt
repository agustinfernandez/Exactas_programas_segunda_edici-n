These dynamics act on a range\nof entitiesincluding behavioural sequences, ideas and artefacts as well as\nindividuals, populations and whole speciesand involve mechanisms at multiple\nlevels, from neurons in brains to inter-population interactions. Studying such\ncomplex phenomena requires an integration of perspectives from a diverse array\nof fields, as well as bridging gaps between traditionally disparate areas of\nstudy. In this article, which also serves as an introduction to the current\nspecial issue, we highlight some specific respects in which the study of\ncultural evolution has benefited and should continue to benefit from an\nintegrative approach. We showcase a number of pioneering studies of cultural\nevolution that bring together numerous disciplines. These studies illustrate\nthe value of perspectives from different fields for understanding cultural\nevolution, such as cognitive science and neuroanatomy, behavioural ecology,\npopulation dynamics, and evolutionary genetics. They also underscore the\nimportance of understanding cultural processes when interpreting research\nabout human genetics, neuroscience, behaviour and evolution.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue Bridging cultural gaps:\ninterdisciplinary studies in human cultural evolution.\n\n### 1\\. Introduction\n\nIn this theme issue we aim to demonstrate synergies between cultural evolution\nand many other fields, including anthropology, biology, psychology,\narchaeology, ecology, genetics and economics. An important aspect of our\nintegrative approach is that it brings ideas and methods from historically\ndisparate fields to bear on cultural evolution, enabling researchers to use\ninsights from a range of fundamentally different perspectives. However, it\nalso presents the challenge that different schools of thought differ in\nparadigms that are sometimes hard to synthesize, such as the kinds of\nempirical and theoretical analyses and the terminology used to describe them.\n\nSome studies focus on cultural evolution from the perspective of the\nindividual, and important insights about the individual-level processes\nunderlying culture have stemmed from research in numerous fields: cognitive\nscience, including the study of creativity and learning [13]; animal\nbehaviour, including the trial-and-error versus culturally transmitted\ncomponents of foraging [4]; and social learning, including learning strategies\nand transmission biases [59]. Other research has focused on the population\nlevel: individuals each undertake trial-and-error and social learning on their\nown, but how do these aggregate when these individuals come together? Studies\nat this level take theoretical and empirical approaches to population-level\ncultural dynamics, including patterns of the accumulation and loss of cultural\ntraits in a population and the interaction between populations [1019]. Yet\nother studies take an even higher-level approach, focusing on species: for\nexample, evolutionary questions surrounding differences in social learning\nmechanisms, cultural niche construction, geneculture coevolution, and the\ncapacity for language in humans and vocal learning in birds [3,2037].\n\nIn addition to differing by their focus on individuals, populations or\nspecies, studies can also consider different units of selection. In Darwinian\ntheory, the reproductive success of the individual determines whether its\ngenetic and/or cultural traits are passed on to the next generation [38]. An\nalternative view of selection, popularized in _The selfish gene_ [39], posits\nthat genes themselves are units of selection, with different genes promoting\ntheir own survival and reproduction without regard for the individual or\npopulation in which they occur. This perspective has been applied to culture,\nsince cultural traits (called memes in _The selfish gene_ ) can also act as\nunits of selection, spreading through a population within a generation even if\nthey decrease individual survival or reproductive success [10,17,39,40]. In\nmost circumstances, evolutionary theory predicts that individuals do not act\nfor the benefit of the group, and the evolution of most behaviours that appear\nto be altruistic can be explained by their benefit to closely related\nindividuals (kin selection) [4143]. However, recently there has been a lively\ndebate about whether aspects of human behaviour, such as cooperation, can be\nexplained by cultural group selection [4451].\n\nStudies may also differ between fields and between researchers with regard to\ntheir economic assumptions about human behaviour. In psychology and\nbehavioural economics, most research is conducted in populations that might\nnot generalize to all humans; some researchers have coined the term WEIRD\n(Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) to underscore the\nfact that these are a small proportion of all human populations, but are\ndisproportionately represented in experimental research [5254]. Studies of\nsmall-scale societies typically make different assumptions, and often come to\ndifferent conclusions, from research in industrialized populations: norms of\ncooperation, sharing, punishment and market forces are quite variable among\nhuman populations [52]. This realization is important to many studies of human\nbehaviour that have been approached from both a cultural evolutionary and an\neconomic perspective: assumptions and generalizations about human behaviour\nrequire great care and should be made explicit in studies involving economic\nforces, game theory, balance of power, division of labour, subsistence\nstrategy and transmission biases (see, for example, the different perspectives\nreflected in [5,8,9,35,49,5559]).\n\nWe suggest that explicitly highlighting these different perspectives may help\nfind commonalities that may bridge the gaps between them and produce insights\nfrom multiple perspectives within the same study. To benefit from different\nperspectives, even within the same study, does not necessarily require a dogma\nas to which is the most appropriate perspective. In the following, we\nhighlight four areas of research in which the synthesis of cultural evolution\nwith another discipline has led to insights that would have been unlikely to\nemerge in each field alone.\n\n### 2\\. The animal continuum: linking human culture to animal behavioural\necology\n\nThe shared essence of many definitions of culture is that it involves\nbehaviours that are socially learned and transmitted and that are maintained\nstably over some period of time [6063]. Humans are quite clearly the most\nadvanced practitioners of culture, but a plethora of studies have clarified\nthat culture is not unique to humans (e.g. [6266]). This is not surprising,\ngiven humans' shared evolutionary origins with all other animals; if anything,\nit is surprising that to demonstrate the existence of culture in a particular\nspecies or context often turns out to be quite challenging, leading to the\nintuition that human culture is sharply different from animal cultures. The\nstudy of animal cultures helps us to be explicit and precise in our\ncharacterization of culture, encourages us to define culture in specific,\nquantifiable terms, and pushes us to explore the dynamics that give rise to\nculture through the study of proximate mechanisms. A promising approach\ninvolves the search for the precursors of human culture among different\norganisms, with whom we share ancestors, and which can be used to research the\nevolution of the cognitive and behavioural traits that give rise to culture,\nas well as to search for regularities in the conditions and context in which\nculture evolves.\n\nThe literature on animal cultures is extensive, and we do not aim to review it\nall here. We demonstrate its value to the study of cultural evolution by\nhighlighting three comparative evolutionary analyses by Whiten [60,61,67],\nwhich integrate experimental and observational data regarding apes and humans.\nThese analyses synthesize studies from the laboratory and the field in order\nto better understand the cognitive mechanisms that underlie culture. In the\nfollowing subsections, we summarize some of the insights from these three\npapers.\n\n#### (a) Local traditions\n\nApes in the wild exhibit socially learned behaviours that vary from one group\nto another. Such learned behaviours famously include fishing for termites, a\nskill that requires prolonged observation, as well as interaction with\nsocially acquired tools and much trial and error. This is elegantly\ndemonstrated by variation in the style of termite fishing between chimpanzee\ngroups, and the observation that juvenile females, who spend more of their\ntime observing their mothers fishing for termites compared with the time spent\nby young males (which are busy with things like play-fighting), master this\nskill, on average, a year earlier than the males [61,68]. Many such cultural\ntraditions exist, including some that seem not to have any immediate utility,\nsuch as a behaviour that emerged and spread among the chimpanzees in one of\nthe groups in a chimpanzee sanctuary in northern Zambia: individuals would\nlodge a tuft of grass into one of their ears and leave it there while engaging\nin other activities [69].\n\n#### (b) Near-absence of cumulative culture\n\nReview of the approximately 40 examples of cultural traditions that have been\ndocumented in chimpanzees [64] helps to highlight an important commonality:\nthe vast majority of traditions are simple enough to arise on short\ntimescales, on the order of much less than a single generation. Examples like\nthe spontaneous emergence of the grass-in-ear behaviour also demonstrate how\nsuch dynamics may take place; although potentially more transient than\nfitness-related activities such as using stick tools to acquire food or leaf\nsponges to collect drinking water [70], it seems that a major difference\nbetween chimpanzee cultures and those of humans is that the former are not\ncumulative in nature. A few possible exceptions have been documented; for\nexample, a specific technique of termite fishing from deep underground nests\nthat might have been developed over multiple generations (e.g. [61,71]). Thus,\nas Whiten notes, this characterization of humans as the sole species with true\ncumulative culture seems quite robust and helps to focus research on the\ndetailed dynamics of cultural inventions and their transmission [60,61,67].\nCan the difference between complex human and simple chimpanzee cultures be\nexplained by a putative inability of the latter to combine learned behaviours\ninto increasingly complex traditions?\n\n#### (c) The mechanisms of cultural behaviour\n\nDrawing upon approaches developed in developmental psychology and the study of\nanimal behaviour, a broad range of experiments have addressed details of\nsocial learning in chimpanzees and humans, particularly among children. These\nhighlight commonalities as well as differences, and support a general trend in\nwhich the precursors of almost every aspect of human social learning are found\nin apes, whereas humans differ quantitatively in a number of respects. Whiten\nhighlights an important one: the relative roles of copying another\nindividual's behaviour (imitation) and copying the context of the behaviour\nand its results (emulation). Both are found in both species, but emulation\nis much more prominent in apes than in human children. An exaggerated form of\ncopying a behaviour (overimitation), including features of the behaviour\nthat are irrelevant to the goal of the physical task, is common among humans\n(including adults), and seems rare in apes. Interpretation of these findings\nis debated, and the role of the experimental context in affecting these trends\nis the focus of many current studies (e.g. it is now clear that in children,\nthe framing of the task strongly influences the extent to which emulation,\nimitation and over-imitation take place [72]). These findings are partially\naccountable for the relatively low fidelity of cultural transmission among\napes as compared with humans, which suggests some possible grounds for the\nnear-absence of cumulative culture among apes.\n\nThe same approach allows Whiten to draw inference about other factors, such as\nconformity, choices about whom to copy, conscious copying of behaviour,\nteaching, and causal inference regarding observed behaviours. Nearly all of\nthese are found to some extent in apes as well as in humans, demonstrating\nthat the underlying prerequisites for culture are graded between species\nrather than dichotomous. Studying these prerequisites provides a fertile\nground for hypothesizing about the role of different factors in giving rise to\nhuman culture, both regarding culture's development on short timescales and in\nthe inference of its dynamics on evolutionary timescales, including the\ncoevolutionary feedback between culture and the genetic predispositions that\nsupport culture-related behaviours [60,61,73,74].\n\nRendell _et al_. [7] demonstrate the utility for the study of cultural\nevolution of integrating approaches from animal behaviour with those in other\nfields. These authors used approaches from artificial intelligence studies,\neconomic game theory and evolutionary biology to organize a social learning\ntournament in which participants submitted a computer-coded behavioural\nstrategy that aims to optimize payoffs in a computer simulation of a changing\nenvironment in which foraging for food takes place in a social context. Each\nagent in the simulation, in each round, could choose to exploit its own\nprevious knowledge or to attempt to learn where to forage by individual trial\nand error or by copying other agents' behaviour. The framework was that of an\nevolutionary simulation, with new agents replacing those that die out, and\nwith the probability of producing offspring proportional to the gained\npayoffs.\n\nIn this tournament, successful strategies focused almost solely on social\nlearning and rarely favoured individual trial and error, despite the potential\ncopying error that was involved in observing others. The value of social\nlearning stemmed from a simple insight: individuals exploiting their\npreviously learned knowledge tend to perform their most successful behaviour\n(in this case: showing which foraging locality yields high rewards), and by\ndoing so they providenot necessarily intentionallypublic information.\nAnother observation was that successful strategies were sensitive to changes\nin the environment such that exploitation of one's own existing knowledge was\nhalted in favour of (social) learning only when it was likely to be more\nvaluable. This study helped to introduce new concepts into the field of\ncultural evolution and allowed cultural evolution to borrow from other fields\na valuable algorithmic frame of thought regarding behavioural strategies.\n\n### 3\\. Population dynamics and cultural evolution: change on ecological\ntimescales\n\nPopulation dynamics play a fundamental role in ecology and evolutionary\nbiology, and they have also played a prominent role in theoretical studies of\ncultural evolution. Interestingly, there are a number of levels at which the\nprocess of cultural evolution can be seen as influencing, or interacting with,\npopulation dynamics. On one hand, since the bearers of culture are individuals\nin a population, that population's dynamics may be influenced by the culture.\nFor example, individuals may have increased fitness when they have a certain\ncultural phenotype, such as knowing how to produce or use a certain tool and\npassing that knowledge from parent to offspring, and the culture may be\ninfluenced by the dynamics that result from these fitness differences. On the\nother hand, one can think of members of a population merely as the bearers of\ncultural traits, and focus on the instances of cultural knowledge themselves\nas the entities whose dynamics are studied. When ideas or cultural traits are\ntreated as individual entities and tracked, the population dynamics are those\nof the population of ideas ([75,76], but see [77] for warnings about\npossible misconceptions inherent in this approach).\n\nThe conceptualization of cultural evolution as a spread of ideas across a\nnetwork was combined with meticulous field observations of chimpanzee\nbehaviour in a study by Hobaiter _et al_. ([70]; see also [78]). These authors\ntracked the emergence and spread of two novel behavioural variants related to\ndrinking water in a group of chimpanzees in Budongo Forest, Uganda: the use of\nmoss-sponges to soak up water from a waterhole and then drink it, and the\nreuse of leaf-sponges for the same purpose (use of leaf-sponges was known in\nthe group previously, but not reuse of discarded leaf-sponges). The animals\nhad discovered a new waterhole, and following its discovery the researchers\nwere able to record all the behaviour near the waterhole for the duration of\nsix consecutive days, thus documenting the first appearance of the novel\nbehaviour, and noting which individuals saw other individuals performing each\nbehaviour.\n\nThe cultural dynamics were represented as a spread of ideas among nodes in a\nnetwork that takes into account the order of events and whose edges describe\nthe number of times that the behaviour was observed, thus giving rise to a\ndynamic network in time. For the first time in the wild, these observations\ndemonstrated the emergence and spread of a cultural variant through social\ntransmission; this is notoriously hard, because it is challenging to rule out\nalternative explanations that do not rely on social transmission. Although the\noccurrence of a certain behaviour in one group of chimpanzees and not in\nothers is suggestive of local cultural traditions, it might also be explained\nby convergence of individually learned behaviours towards the same practice\nowing to environmental pressures, or the behaviour could be innate and simply\nnot observed in other groups because of the different environmental conditions\nor because of geographical variation in the genetic composition of chimpanzee\npopulations [79].\n\nThis analysis explicitly demonstrates an important feature of cultural\nevolution: it may occur on ecological timescales, even extremely short ones,\nproviding a means of adaptation to novel situations. Although this is quite\nevident in modern human cultures, which are relatively easy to track, it is\nonly now becoming clear that it also holds true for some animal cultures (see\nalso [80]), and may help to identify the role and dynamics of cultural\nevolution among earlier hominins as well.\n\nPopulation dynamics may also interact with cultural evolution through\ncompetition between subpopulations of the same species or species complex.\nThrough population replacement, which may be driven by cultural differences,\nor a combination of cultural exchange, competition and partial replacement,\nculturally driven population dynamics may lead to extremely rapid changes, on\ntimescales that are on the order of a few generations, much faster than most\nbiological changes of similar scope (see [44] and commentaries therein). A\nstudy that explores such dynamics in a modelling framework [81] addresses the\nrelatively fast replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans, as reflected in\nthe archaeological record. This study builds on models that link population\nsize to the level of cultural complexity at steady state (e.g. [82,83]), and\nsuggests that a large population of modern humans that existed in Africa could\nhave had a cultural advantage over Neanderthals (in terms, for example, of\nefficiency of utilization of food resources) owing to differences in\npopulation size. The authors show that this advantage would have allowed even\nsmall propagules of migrating moderns to proliferate and eventually replace\nthe Neanderthals in Eurasia. Similar dynamics are proposed to have also taken\nplace in later large-scale human migrations, particularly in the spread of\nNeolithic farmers across Europe [8487] and in the spread of the Yamnaya\npeople in the Bronze period [88].\n\n### 4\\. Cultural evolution and cognition\n\nCultural evolution depends on the transmission of ideas, and to understand\ncultural transmission, we need to also understand the processes of learning\nthat are centred in the brain. Conversely, to fully understand learning, we\nneed to understand not only how individuals acquire and transmit information\nbut also how these processes scale up to a societal level. Thus, cultural\nevolution and cognitive science are interconnected, and integrative analyses\nbetween the two fields have clear mutual benefits.\n\nModels of cultural evolution can benefit from inclusion of insights from\ncognitive science and related fields. For example, 70 years ago, psychological\nstudies noted that learning can be a process that is biased by cultural\nfactors such as the individual's perception of the prestige of the cultural\nmodel (e.g. [89]). More recently, such transmission biases have been\nintegrated into the study of cultural evolution, in particular their effects\non the accumulation of culture in populations [5,8,58,90]. In addition,\nprocesses of innovation and creativity were well studied in the cognitive\nsciences but only sporadically included in cultural evolutionary frameworks,\neven though innovation is an essential source of new cultural traits [91]. By\nmodifying models of cultural evolution to incorporate insights from cognitive\nscience about the process of human innovation, researchers could recreate\ndynamics of cultural accumulation in human populations, including exponential\ngrowth, punctuated bursts, and spontaneous loss of trait complexes\n[16,17,91,92].\n\nA recent paper exemplified the utility of this interdisciplinary approach,\nusing a foundation of cognitive science to propose that innovation and\nimitation work hand-in-hand as drivers of cultural evolution [72]. This study\naddressed how and when humans innovate versus imitate, particularly focusing\non children, who are excellent at imitating how to use tools and how to follow\nsocial conventions. However, innovation skills, particularly for tool\ninnovation, develop relatively slowly in human children, perhaps improving the\nfidelity of cultural transmission by biasing early cultural learning toward\nimitation [72].\n\nAnother set of studies merged cultural evolution, cognitive science and\narchaeology to understand the evolution of stone tool-making [93]. By\nrecording brain activity as subjects made decisions about how to make stone\ntools, the authors found that making tools from the Oldowan (approx. 2.61.4\nMa) required relatively simple skills, but making tools from the Acheulean\ntradition (1.60.25 Ma) required predicting and evaluating the outcome of each\nstone-flaking action, which elicited activity in the prefrontal cortex, a\nregion of the brain implicated in planning, decision-making and innovation\n[93]. Further, it was shown to be difficult for subjects to convey tool-making\nskills to others without the use of language, suggesting that the increasingly\ncomplex cultural artefacts in the archaeological record might be linked to the\nevolution of the capacity for language in ancient populations [94,95]. These\nlines of research suggest specific neural underpinnings for the capacities\nthat make us human, such as the capacities to imitate, to learn socially and\nto plan and evaluate our actions [93,94,96,97].\n\n### 5\\. Genetic and cultural change\n\nThe evolutionary dynamics of genes and culture have some similarities,\nparticularly for cultural traits that are likely to be passed vertically from\nparent to offspring, such as language. Indeed, although he did not know about\ngenes, Darwin himself drew a comparison between biological variation and\ncultural variation, noting that [t]he formation of different languages and of\ndistinct species, and the proofs that both have been developed through a\ngradual process, are curiously parallel [98]. However, cultural traits can\neasily violate the assumptions of genetic transmission: they can be\ntransmitted within a generation, can be learned from parents but also from\nanyone in the population, can be invented or forgotten, and can sometimes\nspread quickly even when they are maladaptive [40,99101]. Many studies in\ncultural evolutionary theory have used models based in theoretical genetics to\nexplore the ramifications of modifying genetic assumptions to accommodate\ncultural transmission [30,40,102106].\n\nIn the 1970s, researchers began to acknowledge, as Durham stated, that the\nfull explanation of human diversity requires attention to both biological and\ncultural processes [107]. The realization that it was important to study\nbiological and cultural variation in tandem stemmed from two different\nsources. First, archaeological research had made it clear that genetic and\ncultural processes had been intertwined in the evolution of humansnot only\nfor the few thousand years of recorded history, but for hundreds of thousands\nif not millions of years of tool use and cultural accumulation in our hominin\nancestors [91,107109]. Second, advances in genetic sequencing technology\nturned the joint analysis of genetic and cultural variation from a lofty goal\ninto a reality [110112]. In their earliest incarnations, analyses of genetic\nand cultural variation affirmed Darwin's suspicions from a hundred years\nprior: there were some clear parallels between genetic phylogenies and\nlanguage trees [112114].\n\nThe integrative studies of genetic and cultural information that followed have\ndeepened our understanding of human history, leading to insights that would\nhave not been possible with either data type alone. For example, the pattern\nof isolation by distance, originating in population genetics, predicts that\nhumans on average have relatively limited dispersal and are thus most likely\nto find a mate nearby. Over time, this pattern of dispersal will lead to a\ngeographical gradient of genetic similarity, with any given population\nexpected to be more genetically similar to nearby populations than to\npopulations further away [115]. Indeed, several studies have observed a\nsignificant relationship between human genetic variation and the geographical\nlocations of the sampled individuals [116118]. An early study of genetic\nvariation in Europe, however, did not find a smooth gradient of genetic\nsimilarity as isolation by distance might have predicted; instead, researchers\nobserved zones of sharp genetic change that primarily corresponded to\nlinguistic boundaries [119], which implies that humans might choose their\nmates not only based on proximity but also based on language, thus restricting\ngene flow between linguistic groups. Another insight from combining the study\nof genetics and culture arises from consideration of two studies that analysed\nthe phylogenetic relations between Austronesian languages and the phylogenetic\nrelations between strains of a human gut bacterium, _Helicobacter pylori_ ,\ncollected in Pacific islander populations [120,121]. Convergence of the\nfindings from these two very different modalities sheds light on the history\nof human populations in the Pacific [122].\n\nMore recent studies that included not only higher resolution genetic data but\nalso more detailed linguistic analyses revealed even more complex patterns\n[21]. In some groups, such as the KraDai-speaking groups in Thailand and sub-\npopulations in England, language is a better predictor of genetic similarity\nthan geographical proximity; thus, in these populations, language appears to\nact as a barrier to gene flow [123,124]. In contrast, detailed analysis of\nseveral regions, such as North America and Melanesia, showed an opposite\nphenomenon: in some cases, language boundaries are preserved between\npopulations, but these language barriers do not appear to restrict gene flow\nbetween the populations [125,126]. Thus, culturally inherited traits such as\nlanguage can create stable boundaries between populations even when these\nboundaries do not restrict gene flow, maintaining a cultural population\nstructure that masks an underlying genetically mixed population. Quantifying\nthese differences helps deepen our understanding of human evolutionary\nhistory, and the patterns could not be uncovered without a truly integrative\nanalysis of cultural evolution and genetic variation.\n\n### 6\\. Summary\n\nIn light of the role of culture in human ecology and evolution [101], we\nsuggest that it would not be an overstatement to paraphrase Dobzhansky [127]\nin saying that _nothing about humans makes sense except in the light of\ncultural evolution_. However, cultural evolution occurs on multiple timescales\nand is driven by dynamics at different levels: individuals, populations of\nbehaving individuals, technological entities and cultural ideas. Analyses at\nthese different levels generate interesting and complementary hypotheses and\nlines of investigation. We suggest that the integrative approach advocated in\nthis special issue has been, and will continue to be, highly productive.
