However, unlike the optical microscope, the atomic force\nmicroscope is a scanning device and thus does not easily lend itself to be an\ninteractive instrument: observations are made accessible to the users in the\nform of grids of data points that can be visualized offline.\n\nThe transformation of the atomic force microscope into an interactive\ninstrument was previously attempted using conventional teleoperation\napproaches [3][5], where scaled position and force signals are cross-linked\nbetween slave and master manipulator devices [6], [7]. When treating the\natomic force microscope like a slave manipulator, however, the phases of\ninteraction where the probe tip is attracted to a sample are inherently\nunstable and thus inaccessible to direct human experience. In the present\nrealization, this shortcoming was eliminated by employing an active probe that\ncould track the entirety of tip-sample microscopic interaction curves.\n\nTeleoperation theory shows that in conventional systems the choice of scaling\ngains is fundamentally limited [8], [9]. In the present design, the active\nprobe was coupled to a novel force-feedback user interface that closely\napproximated a pure force generator, realizing a mechanical scaling instrument\nthat was unconditionally stable for any scaling gains, while maintaining\nquasi-ideal transparency in the frequency range relevant to human interaction.\nDuring operation, the user felt as if she or he was directly interacting with\nan enlarged replica of the sample where the macroscopic exchange of mechanical\nwork done by the hand was six-seven orders of magnitude larger than that\ntaking place in the microscopic world.\n\nThe broad principle of an ideal mechanical scaling instrument may be described\nby one of the two hypothetical devices shown in Figures 1A, B. A probe\ninteracting with a sample moves by an amount, , where to each displacement, ,\ncorresponds a force, , possibly not uniquely. Scaling up a microscopic\ninteraction requires an external source of power since the work, , performed\nby the hand should be orders of magnitude larger than the work, , performed by\nthe probe. If  is the displacement of the handle and if  is the force applied\nby the hand, then , where the value of the product, , should be at least a\nmillion in micro-scale applications (1.0 N  1.0 N, 1.0 m  1.0 mm).\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT \n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG \n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF \n\noriginal image\n\nFigure 1.  Ideal mechanical scaling instrument.\n\n(A, B) Two possible signal causality schemes. (A) The probe is an ideal force\ngenerator, it has no mass and is infinitely compliant. The handle is\ninfinitely rigid and imposes scaled up displacements. Scaled down hand\ninteraction forces are reflected to the probe. (B) The probe is infinitely\nrigid and imposes scaled down displacements to the sample. Scaled up probe\ninteraction forces are applied to the hand through an ideal force generator.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108895.g001\n\nThe scaled mechanical work transferred from the sample to the probe can be\neither generative or dissipative. In the microscopic world, such inversions\nare commonplace, for instance at the onset of adhesion where the probe is\nsuddenly attracted to the sample. Considering that the work to be scaled up is\nat all times the product of force and displacement, two options are available\nto us to constrain the hand to perform a scaled-up replica of the work\nperformed by the probe. In one option, see Figure 1A, the probe is arranged to\nhave sufficiently high mobility  mobility is the ratio of velocity to force \nin order to apply small controlled forces regardless of its movements. These\nprobe forces are scaled-down versions of the measured forces applied by the\nhand onto the handle. Concomitantly, measured probe displacements are relayed\nto the hand through an ideal velocity generator that imposes scaled up\ndisplacements to the hand overcoming any force it applies. In the other\noption, see Figure 1B, the probe must have sufficiently low mobility and the\nmeasured forces of the microscopic interaction are transmitted in amplified\nform to the hand through a high mobility force generator. At the same time,\nthe measured hand displacements are scaled down and imposed to the probe by an\nideal velocity generator.\n\nThe two options are in principle equivalent, but in practice they are quite\ndifferent. In the option of Figure 1A, a high mobility probe can be realized\nby a compliant cantilever with a probing tip, similar to atomic force\nmicroscope implementations. The specification of interaction forces\nindependently from the tip movements then requires to displace the cantilever\nbase at high speeds and with high amplitudes, which is difficult. The\nrealization of the user interface is also difficult. The force of interaction\nbetween the hand and the handle can be confounded with spurious dynamic forces\nowing to the fast movements of the handle. With the option of Figure 1B, the\nrealization of a low mobility probe is easily accomplished using a micro-\npositioner. However, the requirement for low mobility of the probe conflicts\nwith that for force sensitivity. We resolved this conundrum by using feedback\nin an active compensation scheme to convert a high mobility, actuated probe\ninto a low mobility probe, while preserving sensitivity. On the user side, the\nrealization of a force generator of low mobility intended to interact with the\nhand is difficult because the dynamics of actuators are typically of second-\norder. Closed-loop control therefore requires acceleration feedback, which is\nhard to stabilize robustly. We solved this problem by arranging the primary\nforce generator to have inherent first-order dynamics. The scaling down of\ndisplacements is straightforward.\n\nWe realized a practical mechanical scaling instrument following the option\nrepresented in Figure 2A. For brevity, in the foregoing no distinction is made\nbetween forces and torques. The feedback system of the probe comprised a\ndifferential electrostatic actuator having a linear transfer characteristic\n[10] and an optical lever to detect its position. The position of the sample\nrelative to the probe was determined by a micro-positioner made of a voice-\ncoil motor acting against an elastic suspension. The central component of the\nuser interface, the force generator, was a viscous coupler based on the\nprinciple of Foucault currents. These non-contact devices have a near-perfect\nviscous behavior as long as slip velocity is below a critical value [11]. The\narmature was a thin disk of aluminum of low inertia and the relationship\nbetween input slip velocity and output torque was of first order. The output\ntorque was proportional to the relative velocity between the rotor (motor-1)\nand the armature (motor-2 and handle). The control system diagrammed in Figure\n3 was designed to provide properties closely approaching that of the ideal\nmechanical scaling device of Figure 1B.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT \n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG \n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF \n\noriginal image\n\nFigure 2.  Practical realization of the second scheme.\n\n(A) Differential electrostatic comb drive with a moving armature suspended by\na network of glass fibers. The probe, connected to the moving armature,\ninteracts with a sample that is moved by a micro-positioner in response to the\nhandle movements. The position of the probe is detected by an optical lever.\nThe position signal is sent to the control system which returns an actuator\ncontrol voltage that nulls the probe displacement. The control system drives\nthe hand interface by servoing the velocity of motor-1, transmitting torque\nvia a Foucault-current coupler to the handle attached to motor-2. Because the\ntorques add on a common shaft, motor-2 can fill in the missing transients. The\nforces transmitted to the hand do not include the inertial forces arising from\nthe movements of the large motor-1.

Control scheme.\n\nComputational signals and blocks are in blue and physical signals are in red.\nThe control, , looped around the probe, , is designed to achieve high\nstiffness. Electrostatic forces are at all times equal to the interaction\nforces. The force generator operates with a velocity control, , and feed-\nforward compensation taken from the force error signal, . Crucially, the\nphysical summation nodes (red) combine force signals without approximations.\nNodes 1 and 2 represent Newton\'s second law.

Computational\nsummation nodes are all associated to error terms.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108895.g003\n\n## Materials and Methods\n\n### Active probe\n\nThe probe was designed around a bipolar differential electrostatic actuator\nabout 1.0 cm in scale generating a force proportionally to the voltage\napplied, see Figure 2B, D. The moving armature carrying the probe was\nsuspended by a system of five glass fibers that provided exact kinematic\nguidance along one direction with no mechanical hysteresis. The optical lever\ncomprised an external laser source, a mirror attached to the carrier and an\nexternal, four quadrant photodiode. The system exhibited a natural angular\nfrequency of 64 rad/s and a stiffness of 4.0 N/m. In the foregoing,  is the\nLaplace variable.\n\nFeedback control, shown in Figure 3 (left feedback loop), overcame the\nlimitations related to passive sensors by stiffening the probe actively. The\nprobe-sample interaction, , gave rise to a force, , that tended to deflect the\nprobe to a measured position, . The compensator, , forced the probe, , to null\nthe position error, . The known actuator force, , then was, within the\ncontroller bandwidth, an accurate replica of the interaction force, , acting\nas an input disturbance, . The range of forces that can be handled by the\nactive probe was 400 N. With a resolution of 0.4 N, measurements could be\nmade with a dynamic range of three orders of magnitude and the sensitivity was\nwell within the range of capillary forces.\n\nIn Figure 3, node  represents the summation of the forces acting on the moving\narmature of the actuator. Equilibrium was achieved in a wide range of\nconditions owing to the robust stability properties of the feedback within the\ncontrol bandwidth, and when it was smaller than the actuator saturation level.\nThe position feedback controller was optimally designed using  procedures\n[12]. The numerical expressions of the probe and of the controller transfer\nfunctions are given in the supporting information, file Text S1, equations (1)\nand (2). For accuracy, all design procedures for the control system (Figure 3,\ncontinuous time) were carried out in the discrete time domain with a sampling\nperiod of 1.0 ms.\n\nThe sample was displaced by a micro-positioner to a position . Its transfer\nfunction, , could be for all practical purposes taken to be unity, .\n\n### User interface\n\nThe force-feedback user interface comprised two stages as shown by Figures 2A,\nC. It had a large motor (motor-1) that produced torque transfered to a small\nmotor (motor-2) through a Foucault-current viscous coupler. The small motor\nwas rigidly connected to a handle having very low inertia. The large motor\n(Maxon RE-35-273754) drove the inductor of the coupler. The inductor was\nfitted with sixty 20 mm2 neodymium magnets. The rotor was a 1 mm thick, 52 mm\nouter diameter aluminum annulus. The shaft positions of the two motors were\ndetected by high-resolution digital encoders (MicroE Mercury M1800). The\ncoupler\'s viscous coefficient was 8.7 104 N m s .\n\nA velocity feedback controller,  (see Figure 3 right feedback loop), set the\nvelocity of motor-1, , to achieve a desired force output, . The controller was\nimplemented as a discrete-time, polynomial pole-placement compensator that\nensured robust regulation and tracking performance [13]. The numerical\nexpressions of the controller and the reference model are given in supporting\ninformation, file Text S1, equations (3) to (6).\n\nSince the bandwidth of human voluntary movements was well within the bandwidth\nof the velocity control loop, the dynamics of motor-1 was entirely eliminated\nfrom the user\'s haptic experience [14]. Nevertheless, the force signal to be\nreproduced could contain fast components that the velocity servo loop could\nnot track. To fill-in the transients, a feed-forward path was provided through\nthe low-power, high-precision motor-2 (Maxon RE-16-118698). Because this motor\nhad negligible friction and inertia, unwanted forces could be kept below human\ndetection thresholds, achieving quasi-perfect transparency.\n\nThe quantitative evaluation of the transparency of the interface was reported\nin [14]. It was designed to operate at the limits of human sensory detection\nperformance with an equivalent inertia of 5.2 g and a friction of 3.7 mN at\nthe finger contact with the manipulandum. The improved transparency of the\ninterface allowed users to detect details that were ten times smaller in\nmagnitude than those detected when using a conventional design.\n\nThe summation node  in Figure 3 represents the sum of all forces that acted on\nmotor-1, namely, the low-frequency viscous force arising from the coupler slip\nvelocity (node ), , the force applied by the user\'s hand, , and the transient\nfeed-forward error signal, . The position of the handle, that is of motor-2, ,\nwas scaled by a factor, , to determine the position, , of the sample.\n\n### System closed-loop stability\n\nIt can be shown that such a system was stable for any bounded value of the\nscaling factors,  and . Closed-loop stability was unconditional for any\nnonlinear interactions between the probe and sample, , and between the handle\nand hand, . In the worst case when no dissipation was present, a sufficient\nproof of stability was achieved through the application of the Llewellyn\'s\nabsolute stability criterion [15], [16]. Alternatively, it can be verified\nthat all the system\'s poles had a negative real part and the real part of the\ntransfer function was positive over the entire bandwidth, from DC to 64 rad/s.\nPassivity of the entire interaction chain was then guaranteed given that the\ninterconnection of linear time invariant passive systems yields a passive\nsystem. Since , and since  up to the open-loop dynamics of the small motor, we\nhave  which means that the user felt a nearly exact replica of the probe-\nsample interaction dynamics scaled by a factor, , without any gain-stability\ntrade-off.\n\n## Results\n\nThe bilateral capability of the system was first tested by exploring the\ninteraction curve between a small fragment of a magnet and the point of a\nsewing needle. When the feedback loop was inactive, the system behaved like an\natomic force microscope cantilever probe, exhibiting an unstable jump-to-\ncontact motion once the attraction force exceeded the elastic force\nrestraining the probe, see Figure 4. In contrast, the active probe could track\nthe entirety of the magnetic interaction force regardless of the proximity to\nthe sample, eliminating measurement hysteresis and the blind region, up to\nactuator saturation.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT \n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG \n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF \n\noriginal image\n\nFigure 4.  Active vs passive probe proving experiment.\n\nA sewing needle tip interacts with a magnet. In passive mode, owing to the\nhigh compliance of the probe, the interaction becomes unstable when the gap\nbecomes smaller than 0.8 mm, whereas, in active mode, the interaction remains\ntractable down to 90 m, until the actuator saturates. In the active mode,\napproach and retraction curves fall on top of each other, denoting absence of\nhysteresis, and the gap may be arbitrarily small, subject to actuator\nsaturation (400 N). In the passive mode, the measurement is erroneous owing\nto uncontrolled probe dynamics.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108895.g004\n\nThe repeatability, the sensitivity, and the noise performance of the system\nwere then assessed. One hundred and seventy-five cyclical interactions with\nthe same droplet of water at a rate of one per second showed that the\nmeasurements were repeatable, see Figure 5A, differing only by a small drift\nfrom cycle to cycle. If the system was sensitive to capillary forces,\nfollowing the Young-Laplace law, the force measurements at pull-off should\ndepend on the probe diameter according to  where  is the probe radius and  the\nsurface tension. The interactions reported in Figure 5B showed that it was\nindeed the case for probe diameters of 80, 140, and 200 m. Finally the noise\nperformance is reported in Figure 5C.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT \n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG \n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF \n\noriginal image\n\nFigure 5.

(C) Noise spectral density of the unloaded\nforce sensor.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108895.g005\n\nThe system was then validated by probing droplets of water with a glass\nmicropipette having a tip diameter of 80 m as illustrated by Figure 6A. The\ndifferent phases of the interaction were felt by the experimenter as if she or\nhe was directly touching the droplet, but with the difference that the\nmechanical work done by the hand of the experimenter was at all times 3.5\nmillion times larger than that of the probe as can be seen from the signals\nshown in Figure 6B, C. When first touching the droplet surface, the\nexperimenter felt a sudden jolt, a step of  N in 50 ms visible in Figure 6C,\nat the end of the approach phase, corresponding to the formation of the\nmeniscus at the instant of pull-in. Subsequently, the interaction force\nincreased with the penetration distance. This increase was likely to be due to\na combination of the enlargement of the meniscus and of the piston section\nresponding to the positive hydrostatic pressure inside the droplet. A reversed\nmovement during the retraction phase corresponded to a strong adhesive force\nthat increased to  N, that is 8.0 N in reality, see Figure 6B, C, where the\nforce becomes negative, until the contact snapped when the droplet was\ndeflected by 250 m from the initial contact at distance zero.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT \n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG \n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF \n\noriginal image\n\nFigure 6.  Interaction of a glass probe with a droplet of water.\n\n(A) Main interaction phases. (B) Evolution of the probe force, , as a function\nof probe displacement and as a function of time. In the approach phase, the\nforce signals are reduced to noise. At the instant of contact, the probe is\nsuddenly attracted by the droplet owing to capillary forces. Penetrating the\ndroplet corresponds to a gradual increase of the interaction force. Retraction\ninverts the sign of the force and the interaction exhibits large hysteresis\nuntil the contact snaps off when exceeding a given deflection. (C) Force felt\nby the hand, that is , that accurately replicates the microscopic interaction.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108895.g006\n\nThe nature and magnitude of forces during this interaction are representative\nof an insect\'s leg adhering to a substrate [17], [18]. A similar maneuver\nexecuted with the leg of a house fly, as reported by Figure 7, let the\nexperimenter directly experience the fact that the multi-scale structure of\nthe leg of an insect greatly magnified the interaction forces, although the\nleg was actually smaller than the glass probe. The file Video S1 shows a live\nant interacting with a water droplet where the magnified interaction forces\nexperienced by the ant are felt by a human observer.\n\nDownload:\n\n  * PPT \n\nPowerPoint slide\n\n  * PNG \n\nlarger image\n\n  * TIFF \n\noriginal image\n\nFigure 7.

While\nthe fly\'s leg is of similar size than the glass probe, interaction forces are\nten fold larger with the insect leg than with the glass probe.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0108895.g007\n\n## Discussion\n\nThe mechanical scaling instrument gave direct access to micro-scale phenomena\npreviously not felt by humans, although they could be seen through a\nmicroscope and measured through conventional instruments. The probe had very\nlow mobility compared to the sample but high force sensitivity and the handle\nhad very high mobility compared to the hand and could eliminate most spurious\nforces from the interaction. These combined properties provided nearly perfect\ntransparency without any stability trade-off so that scaling gains could be\nmade arbitrarily high, subject only to saturation. Other practical limits were\ndue to the inertia of the probe, which could be reduced through\nminiaturization, and to sensing noise in the optical lever which could be\nreplaced by an interferometric measurement technique.\n\nThe availability of interactive manipulation at the micro-scale enables many\nimmediate applications ranging from the handling and probing of biomaterials\nto the assembly of microstructures. Because operation is achieved through\nfeedback control, this technique lends itself naturally to coupling manual\ncontrol with automation, similarly to many successful applications of robotic\ntechnologies, such as surgical robotics or robotic space exploration. Paths\nfor improvements include miniaturization of the probe and expansion of the\nsystem to multiple degrees of freedom.\n\n## Supporting Information\n\n### Data S1.\n\n**Raw data underlying the findings.** This compressed archive contains all the\nexperimental data related to our study.
