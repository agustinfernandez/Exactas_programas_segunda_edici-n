WATSON, M.D., _late of\nthe Army Medical Department._ ) 2\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.\n\nIN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of\nLondon, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for\nsurgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached\nto the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was\nstationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan\nwar had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced\nthrough the passes, and was already deep in the enemys country. I followed,\nhowever, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself,\nand succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and\nat once entered upon my new duties.\n\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing\nbut misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the\nBerkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was\nstruck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed\nthe subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous\nGhazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my\norderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely\nto the British lines.\n\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I\nwas removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at\nPeshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to\nwalk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was\nstruck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months\nmy life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became\nconvalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that\nnot a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched,\naccordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on\nPortsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission\nfrom a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to\nimprove it.\n\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as airor as\nfree as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to\nbe. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great\ncesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly\ndrained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand,\nleading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I\nhad, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my\nfinances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis\nand rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete\nalteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by\nmaking up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\n\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the\nCriterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I\nrecognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight\nof a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing\nindeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony\nof mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared\nto be delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch\nwith me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.\n\nWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson? he asked in undisguised\nwonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. You are as thin as\na lath and as brown as a nut.\n\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the\ntime that we reached our destination.\n\nPoor devil! he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\nmisfortunes. What are you up to now?\n\nLooking for lodgings. 3 I answered. Trying to solve the problem as to\nwhether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\n\nThats a strange thing, remarked my companion; you are the second man to-\nday that has used that expression to me.\n\nAnd who was the first? I asked.\n\nA fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital. He was\nbemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go halves\nwith him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much for\nhis purse.\n\nBy Jove! I cried, if he really wants someone to share the rooms and the\nexpense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner to being\nalone.\n\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. You dont\nknow Sherlock Holmes yet, he said; perhaps you would not care for him as a\nconstant companion.\n\nWhy, what is there against him?\n\nOh, I didnt say there was anything against him. He is a little queer in his\nideasan enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I know he is a\ndecent fellow enough.\n\nA medical student, I suppose? said I.\n\nNoI have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well up in\nanatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never\ntaken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and\neccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would\nastonish his professors.\n\nDid you never ask him what he was going in for? I asked.\n\nNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\n\nI should like to meet him, I said. If I am to lodge with anyone, I should\nprefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand\nmuch noise or excitement. I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for\nthe remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?\n\nHe is sure to be at the laboratory, returned my companion. He either avoids\nthe place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to night. If you\nlike, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\n\nCertainly, I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\nchannels.\n\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me\na few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a\nfellow-lodger.\n\nYou mustnt blame me if you dont get on with him, he said; I know nothing\nmore of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in the\nlaboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\nresponsible.\n\nIf we dont get on it will be easy to part company, I answered. It seems to\nme, Stamford, I added, looking hard at my companion, that you have some\nreason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellows temper so\nformidable, or what is it? Dont be mealy-mouthed about it.\n\nIt is not easy to express the inexpressible, he answered with a laugh.\nHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastesit approaches to cold-\nbloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest\nvegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of\na spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do\nhim justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He\nappears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.\n\nVery right too.\n\nYes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the subjects in\nthe dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre\nshape.\n\nBeating the subjects!\n\nYes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him at it\nwith my own eyes.\n\nAnd yet you say he is not a medical student?\n\nNo. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and\nyou must form your own impressions about him. As he spoke, we turned down a\nnarrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of\nthe great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as\nwe ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor\nwith its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further\nend a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical\nlaboratory.\n\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad,\nlow tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and\nlittle Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames. There was only one\nstudent in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his\nwork. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a\ncry of pleasure. Ive found it! Ive found it, he shouted to my companion,\nrunning towards us with a test-tube in his hand. I have found a re-agent\nwhich is precipitated by hoemoglobin, 4 and by nothing else. Had he\ndiscovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his\nfeatures.\n\nDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, said Stamford, introducing us.\n\nHow are you? he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I\nshould hardly have given him credit. You have been in Afghanistan, I\nperceive.\n\nHow on earth did you know that? I asked in astonishment.\n\nNever mind, said he, chuckling to himself. The question now is about\nhoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?\n\nIt is interesting, chemically, no doubt, I answered, but practically\n\nWhy, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years. Dont\nyou see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here\nnow! He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me over to\nthe table at which he had been working. Let us have some fresh blood, he\nsaid, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting\ndrop of blood in a chemical pipette. Now, I add this small quantity of blood\nto a litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the\nappearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a\nmillion. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the\ncharacteristic reaction. As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white\ncrystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the\ncontents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated\nto the bottom of the glass jar.\n\nHa! ha! he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child\nwith a new toy. What do you think of that?\n\nIt seems to be a very delicate test, I remarked.\n\nBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So\nis the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless\nif the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether\nthe blood is old or new. Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of\nmen now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their\ncrimes.\n\nIndeed! I murmured.\n\nCriminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His linen or\nclothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them. Are they blood\nstains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That\nis a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why? Because there was no\nreliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes test, and there will no longer\nbe any difficulty.\n\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart and\nbowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.\n\nYou are to be congratulated, I remarked, considerably surprised at his\nenthusiasm.\n\nThere was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would certainly\nhave been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of\nBradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of\nNew Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it would have been\ndecisive.\n\nYou seem to be a walking calendar of crime, said Stamford with a laugh. You\nmight start a paper on those lines. Call it the Police News of the Past.\n\nVery interesting reading it might be made, too, remarked Sherlock Holmes,\nsticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger. I have to be\ncareful, he continued, turning to me with a smile, for I dabble with poisons\na good deal. He held out his hand as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all\nmottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong\nacids.\n\nWe came here on business, said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged\nstool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot. My friend here\nwants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one\nto go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.\n\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. I\nhave my eye on a suite in Baker Street, he said, which would suit us down to\nthe ground. You dont mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?\n\nI always smoke ships myself, I answered.\n\nThats good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do\nexperiments. Would that annoy you?\n\nBy no means.\n\nLet me seewhat are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at times, and\ndont open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do\nthat. Just let me alone, and Ill soon be right. What have you to confess now?\nIts just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they\nbegin to live together.\n\nI laughed at this cross-examination. I keep a bull pup, I said, and I\nobject to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of\nungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices when Im\nwell, but those are the principal ones at present.\n\nDo you include violin-playing in your category of rows? he asked, anxiously.\n\nIt depends on the player, I answered. A well-played violin is a treat for\nthe godsa badly-played one\n\nOh, thats all right, he cried, with a merry laugh. I think we may consider\nthe thing as settledthat is, if the rooms are agreeable to you.\n\nWhen shall we see them?\n\nCall for me here at noon to-morrow, and well go together and settle\neverything, he answered.\n\nAll rightnoon exactly, said I, shaking his hand.\n\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my\nhotel.\n\nBy the way, I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, how the\ndeuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\n\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. Thats just his little\npeculiarity, he said. A good many people have wanted to know how he finds\nthings out.\n\nOh! a mystery is it? I cried, rubbing my hands. This is very piquant. I am\nmuch obliged to you for bringing us together. The proper study of mankind is\nman, you know.\n\nYou must study him, then, Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye. Youll\nfind him a knotty problem, though. Ill wager he learns more about you than\nyou about him. Good-bye.\n\nGood-bye, I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested\nin my new acquaintance.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.\n\nWE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, 5\nBaker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a\ncouple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room,\ncheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in\nevery way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided\nbetween us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once\nentered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the\nhotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several\nboxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking\nand laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually\nbegan to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings.\n\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his\nways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at\nnight, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the\nmorning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in\nthe dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take\nhim into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when\nthe working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him,\nand for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly\nuttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I\nhave noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have\nsuspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the\ntemperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\n\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his aims in\nlife, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were\nsuch as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was\nrather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be\nconsiderably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those\nintervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave\nhis whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the\nprominence and squareness which mark the man of determination. His hands were\ninvariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed\nof extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\nwhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\n\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much\nthis man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through\nthe reticence which he showed on all that concerned himself. Before\npronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life,\nand how little there was to engage my attention. My health forbade me from\nventuring out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no\nfriends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence.\nUnder these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung\naround my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\n\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\nconfirmed Stamfords opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to have\npursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in science or\nany other recognized portal which would give him an entrance into the learned\nworld. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric\nlimits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his\nobservations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man would work so hard or\nattain such precise information unless he had some definite end in view.\nDesultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning.\nNo man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason\nfor doing so.\n\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature,\nphilosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting\nThomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had\ndone. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he\nwas ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar\nSystem. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not\nbe aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an\nextraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.\n\nYou appear to be astonished, he said, smiling at my expression of surprise.\nNow that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\n\nTo forget it!\n\nYou see, he explained, I consider that a mans brain originally is like a\nlittle empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you\nchoose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so\nthat the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best\nis jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying\nhis hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what\nhe takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may\nhelp him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in\nthe most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has\nelastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time\nwhen for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew\nbefore. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts\nelbowing out the useful ones.\n\nBut the Solar System! I protested.\n\nWhat the deuce is it to me? he interrupted impatiently; you say that we go\nround the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of\ndifference to me or to my work.\n\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something in his\nmanner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I pondered over\nour short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from\nit. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his\nobject. Therefore all the knowledge which he possessed was such as would be\nuseful to him. I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which\nhe had shown me that he was exceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil\nand jotted them down. I could not help smiling at the document when I had\ncompleted it. It ran in this way\n\nSHERLOCK HOLMEShis limits.\n\n    \n    \r\n      1. Knowledge of Literature.Nil.\r\n      2.

After walks has\r\n                                   shown me splashes upon his trousers,\r\n                                   and told me by their colour and\r\n                                   consistence in what part of London\r\n                                   he had received them.\r\n      7.

Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\r\n      12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\r\n    \n\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair. If I\ncan only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these\naccomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all, I said to\nmyself, I may as well give up the attempt at once.\n\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These were very\nremarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments. That he could\nplay pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he has\nplayed me some of Mendelssohns Lieder, and other favourites. When left to\nhimself, however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized\nair. Leaning back in his arm-chair of an evening, he would close his eyes and\nscrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his knee. Sometimes\nthe chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and\ncheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether\nthe music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result\nof a whim or fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled\nagainst these exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated\nthem by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\nslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\n\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that\nmy companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently, however, I\nfound that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes\nof society. There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was\nintroduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single\nweek. One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for\nhalf an hour or more. The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor,\nlooking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was\nclosely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a\nrailway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these nondescript\nindividuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of\nthe sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room. He always apologized to\nme for putting me to this inconvenience. I have to use this room as a place\nof business, he said, and these people are my clients. Again I had an\nopportunity of asking him a point blank question, and again my delicacy\nprevented me from forcing another man to confide in me. I imagined at the time\nthat he had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he soon dispelled\nthe idea by coming round to the subject of his own accord.\n\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose\nsomewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet\nfinished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my late\nhabits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the\nunreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation\nthat I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to\nwhile away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast.\nOne of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to\nrun my eye through it.\n\nIts somewhat ambitious title was The Book of Life, and it attempted to show\nhow much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\nexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable\nmixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense,\nbut the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The\nwriter claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of\nan eye, to fathom a mans inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an\nimpossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His\nconclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling\nwould his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the\nprocesses by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a\nnecromancer.\n\nFrom a drop of water, said the writer, a logician could infer the\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or\nthe other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever\nwe are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of\nDeduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient\nstudy nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest\npossible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of\nthe matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by\nmastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn\nat a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession\nto which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for.\nBy a mans finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser\nknees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by\nhis shirt cuffsby each of these things a mans calling is plainly revealed.\nThat all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is\nalmost inconceivable.\n\nWhat ineffable twaddle! I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, I\nnever read such rubbish in my life.\n\nWhat is it? asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nWhy, this article, I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to\nmy breakfast. I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I dont\ndeny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It is evidently the\ntheory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes\nin the seclusion of his own study. It is not practical. I should like to see\nhim clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to\ngive the trades of all his fellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one\nagainst him.\n\nYou would lose your money, Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. As for the\narticle I wrote it myself.\n\nYou!\n\nYes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The theories which\nI have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really\nextremely practicalso practical that I depend upon them for my bread and\ncheese.\n\nAnd how? I asked involuntarily.\n\nWell, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world. Im\na consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we\nhave lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones. When these\nfellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right\nscent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the\nhelp of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight. There is a\nstrong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a\nthousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you cant unravel the thousand and\nfirst. Lestrade is a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently\nover a forgery case, and that was what brought him here.\n\nAnd these other people?\n\nThey are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who\nare in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening. I listen to\ntheir story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.\n\nBut do you mean to say, I said, that without leaving your room you can\nunravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen\nevery detail for themselves?\n\nQuite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case turns up\nwhich is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things\nwith my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to\nthe problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of\ndeduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable\nto me in practical work. Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to\nbe surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from\nAfghanistan.\n\nYou were told, no doubt.\n\nNothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long habit the\ntrain of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the\nconclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps. There were such\nsteps, however. The train of reasoning ran, Here is a gentleman of a medical\ntype, but with the air of a military man. Clearly an army doctor, then. He has\njust come from the tropics, for his face is dark, and that is not the natural\ntint of his skin, for his wrists are fair. He has undergone hardship and\nsickness, as his haggard face says clearly. His left arm has been injured. He\nholds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an\nEnglish army doctor have seen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly\nin Afghanistan. The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then\nremarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\n\nIt is simple enough as you explain it, I said, smiling. You remind me of\nEdgar Allen Poes Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside\nof stories.\n\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. No doubt you think that you are\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin, he observed. Now, in my opinion,\nDupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking in on his\nfriends thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hours silence\nis really very showy and superficial. He had some analytical genius, no doubt;\nbut he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.\n\nHave you read Gaboriaus works? I asked. Does Lecoq come up to your idea of\na detective?\n\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. Lecoq was a miserable bungler, he\nsaid, in an angry voice; he had only one thing to recommend him, and that was\nhis energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify\nan unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six\nmonths or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what\nto avoid.\n\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in\nthis cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into\nthe busy street. This fellow may be very clever, I said to myself, but he\nis certainly very conceited.\n\nThere are no crimes and no criminals in these days, he said, querulously.\nWhat is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have\nit in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has ever lived who has\nbrought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of\ncrime which I have done. And what is the result? There is no crime to detect,\nor, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a\nScotland Yard official can see through it.\n\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best\nto change the topic.\n\nI wonder what that fellow is looking for? I asked, pointing to a stalwart,\nplainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the\nstreet, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had a large blue envelope in his\nhand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.\n\nYou mean the retired sergeant of Marines, said Sherlock Holmes.\n\nBrag and bounce! thought I to myself. He knows that I cannot verify his\nguess.\n\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the\nroadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending\nthe stair.\n\nFor Mr. Sherlock Holmes, he said, stepping into the room and handing my\nfriend the letter.\n\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little thought of\nthis when he made that random shot. May I ask, my lad, I said, in the\nblandest voice, what your trade may be?\n\nCommissionaire, sir, he said, gruffly. Uniform away for repairs.\n\nAnd you were? I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion.\n\nA sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir.\n\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was gone.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER III. THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY 6\n\nI CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\npractical nature of my companions theories. My respect for his powers of\nanalysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking suspicion in\nmy mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode, intended to\ndazzle me, though what earthly object he could have in taking me in was past\nmy comprehension. When I looked at him he had finished reading the note, and\nhis eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental\nabstraction.\n\nHow in the world did you deduce that? I asked.\n\nDeduce what? said he, petulantly.\n\nWhy, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\n\nI have no time for trifles, he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,\nExcuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as\nwell. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of\nMarines?\n\nNo, indeed.\n\nIt was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you were asked to\nprove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you\nare quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue\nanchor tattooed on the back of the fellows hand. That smacked of the sea. He\nhad a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have\nthe marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air\nof command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung\nhis cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of himall\nfacts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\n\nWonderful! I ejaculated.\n\nCommonplace, said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he was\npleased at my evident surprise and admiration. I said just now that there\nwere no criminals. It appears that I am wronglook at this! He threw me over\nthe note which the commissionaire had brought. 7\n\nWhy, I cried, as I cast my eye over it, this is terrible!\n\nIt does seem to be a little out of the common, he remarked, calmly. Would\nyou mind reading it to me aloud?\n\nThis is the letter which I read to him\n\nMY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,\n\nThere has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens, off\nthe Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in the\nmorning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something was\namiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare of\nfurniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and having cards\nin his pocket bearing the name of Enoch J. Drebber, Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.\nThere had been no robbery, nor is there any evidence as to how the man met his\ndeath. There are marks of blood in the room, but there is no wound upon his\nperson. We are at a loss as to how he came into the empty house; indeed, the\nwhole affair is a puzzler. If you can come round to the house any time before\ntwelve, you will find me there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I\nhear from you. If you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and\nwould esteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\nYours faithfully,\n\nTOBIAS GREGSON.\n\nGregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders, my friend remarked; he and\nLestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and energetic, but\nconventionalshockingly so. They have their knives into one another, too. They\nare as jealous as a pair of professional beauties. There will be some fun over\nthis case if they are both put upon the scent.\n\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. Surely there is not a\nmoment to be lost, I cried, shall I go and order you a cab?\n\nIm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy devil\nthat ever stood in shoe leatherthat is, when the fit is on me, for I can be\nspry enough at times.\n\nWhy, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\n\nMy dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the whole\nmatter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will pocket all the\ncredit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\n\nBut he begs you to help him.\n\nYes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would\ncut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person. However, we may\nas well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a\nlaugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\n\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an\nenergetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\n\nGet your hat, he said.\n\nYou wish me to come?\n\nYes, if you have nothing better to do. A minute later we were both in a\nhansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\n\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-\ntops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath. My\ncompanion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles,\nand the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati. As for myself, I was\nsilent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were\nengaged, depressed my spirits.\n\nYou dont seem to give much thought to the matter in hand, I said at last,\ninterrupting Holmes musical disquisition.\n\nNo data yet, he answered. It is a capital mistake to theorize before you\nhave all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\n\nYou will have your data soon, I remarked, pointing with my finger; this is\nthe Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.\n\nSo it is. Stop, driver, stop! We were still a hundred yards or so from it,\nbut he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.\n\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one\nof four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied\nand two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy\nwindows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a To Let card\nhad developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. A small garden sprinkled\nover with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses\nfrom the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour,\nand consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place\nwas very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night. The garden\nwas bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the\ntop, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded\nby a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in\nthe vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\n\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house\nand plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be further from\nhis intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances,\nseemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up and down the pavement,\nand gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of\nrailings. Having finished his scrutiny, he proceeded slowly down the path, or\nrather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his eyes\nriveted upon the ground. Twice he stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard\nhim utter an exclamation of satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps\nupon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over\nit, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his perceptive\nfaculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal which was hidden\nfrom me.\n\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, flaxen-haired\nman, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and wrung my companions\nhand with effusion. It is indeed kind of you to come, he said, I have had\neverything left untouched.\n\nExcept that! my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. If a herd of\nbuffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No doubt,\nhowever, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted\nthis.\n\nI have had so much to do inside the house, the detective said evasively. My\ncolleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him to look after this.\n\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. With two such men\nas yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third\nparty to find out, he said.\n\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. I think we have done all\nthat can be done, he answered; its a queer case though, and I knew your\ntaste for such things.\n\nYou did not come here in a cab? asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nNo, sir.\n\nNor Lestrade?\n\nNo, sir.\n\nThen let us go and look at the room. With which inconsequent remark he\nstrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his\nastonishment.\n\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two\ndoors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these had\nobviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room,\nwhich was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred. Holmes\nwalked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling at my heart which the\npresence of death inspires.\n\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all\nfurniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in\nplaces with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and\nhung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath. Opposite the door was a showy\nfireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one\ncorner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle. The solitary window\nwas so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge\nto everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated\nthe whole apartment.\n\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was centred\nupon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards,\nwith vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling. It was that\nof a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad\nshouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard. He was\ndressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured\ntrousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim,\nwas placed upon the floor beside him. His hands were clenched and his arms\nthrown abroad, while his lower limbs were interlocked as though his death\nstruggle had been a grievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression\nof horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon\nhuman features. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\nunnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared\nto me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which\nlooked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.\n\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\ngreeted my companion and myself.\n\nThis case will make a stir, sir, he remarked. It beats anything I have\nseen, and I am no chicken.\n\nThere is no clue? said Gregson.\n\nNone at all, chimed in Lestrade.\n\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently.\nYou are sure that there is no wound? he asked, pointing to numerous gouts\nand splashes of blood which lay all round.\n\nPositive! cried both detectives.\n\nThen, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual8 presumably the\nmurderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of the circumstances\nattendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year 34. Do you\nremember the case, Gregson?\n\nNo, sir.\n\nRead it upyou really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all\nbeen done before.\n\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,\nfeeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same far-\naway expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was the\nexamination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which\nit was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead mans lips, and then glanced at\nthe soles of his patent leather boots.\n\nHe has not been moved at all? he asked.\n\nNo more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\n\nYou can take him to the mortuary now, he said. There is nothing more to be\nlearned.\n\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered the\nroom, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him, a ring\ntinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at\nit with mystified eyes.\n\nTheres been a woman here, he cried. Its a womans wedding-ring.\n\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered round\nhim and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold\nhad once adorned the finger of a bride.\n\nThis complicates matters, said Gregson. Heaven knows, they were complicated\nenough before.\n\nYoure sure it doesnt simplify them? observed Holmes. Theres nothing to\nbe learned by staring at it. What did you find in his pockets?\n\nWe have it all here, said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one\nof the bottom steps of the stairs. A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of\nLondon. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring, with masonic\ndevice. Gold pinbull-dogs head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-\ncase, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E.\nJ. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds\nthirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccios Decameron, with name of Joseph\nStangerson upon the fly-leaf. Two lettersone addressed to E. J. Drebber and\none to Joseph Stangerson.\n\nAt what address?\n\nAmerican Exchange, Strandto be left till called for. They are both from the\nGuion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from\nLiverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New\nYork.\n\nHave you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\n\nI did it at once, sir, said Gregson. I have had advertisements sent to all\nthe newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he\nhas not returned yet.\n\nHave you sent to Cleveland?\n\nWe telegraphed this morning.\n\nHow did you word your inquiries?\n\nWe simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any\ninformation which could help us.\n\nYou did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be\ncrucial?\n\nI asked about Stangerson.\n\nNothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to\nhinge? Will you not telegraph again?\n\nI have said all I have to say, said Gregson, in an offended voice.\n\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some\nremark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding\nthis conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his hands in\na pompous and self-satisfied manner.\n\nMr. Gregson, he said, I have just made a discovery of the highest\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful\nexamination of the walls.\n\nThe little mans eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in a state of\nsuppressed exultation at having scored a point against his colleague.\n\nCome here, he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which\nfelt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. Now, stand there!\n\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\n\nLook at that! he said, triumphantly.\n\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular\ncorner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of\ncoarse plastering. Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red\nletters a single word\n\n    \n    \r\n                             RACHE.\r\n    \n\nWhat do you think of that? cried the detective, with the air of a showman\nexhibiting his show. This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner\nof the room, and no one thought of looking there. The murderer has written it\nwith his or her own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall!\nThat disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to\nwrite it on? I will tell you. See that candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit\nat the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of\nthe darkest portion of the wall.\n\nAnd what does it mean now that you _have_ found it? asked Gregson in a\ndepreciatory voice.\n\nMean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel,\nbut was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark my words, when\nthis case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has\nsomething to do with it. Its all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock\nHolmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when\nall is said and done.\n\nI really beg your pardon! said my companion, who had ruffled the little\nmans temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. You certainly have\nthe credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it\nbears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last\nnights mystery. I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your\npermission I shall do so now.\n\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from\nhis pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly about the room,\nsometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his face.\nSo engrossed was he with his occupation that he appeared to have forgotten our\npresence, for he chattered away to himself under his breath the whole time,\nkeeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries\nsuggestive of encouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly\nreminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across\nthe lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his researches,\nmeasuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were\nentirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his tape to the walls in\nan equally incomprehensible manner. In one place he gathered up very carefully\na little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope.\nFinally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall, going over every\nletter of it with the most minute exactness. This done, he appeared to be\nsatisfied, for he replaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\n\nThey say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains, he remarked\nwith a smile. Its a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective\nwork.\n\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres 9 of their amateur companion\nwith considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently failed to\nappreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes\nsmallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.\n\nWhat do you think of it, sir? they both asked.\n\nIt would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help\nyou, remarked my friend. You are doing so well now that it would be a pity\nfor anyone to interfere. There was a world of sarcasm in his voice as he\nspoke. If you will let me know how your investigations go, he continued, I\nshall be happy to give you any help I can. In the meantime I should like to\nspeak to the constable who found the body. Can you give me his name and\naddress?\n\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. John Rance, he said. He is off duty now.\nYou will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\n\nHolmes took a note of the address.\n\nCome along, Doctor, he said; we shall go and look him up. Ill tell you one\nthing which may help you in the case, he continued, turning to the two\ndetectives. There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man. He was\nmore than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his\nheight, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar. He\ncame here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse\nwith three old shoes and one new one on his off fore leg. In all probability\nthe murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his right hand were\nremarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.\n\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\n\nIf this man was murdered, how was it done? asked the former.\n\nPoison, said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. One other thing,\nLestrade, he added, turning round at the door: Rache, is the German for\nrevenge; so dont lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\n\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed\nbehind him.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL.\n\nIT was one oclock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led\nme to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a long telegram. He\nthen hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us\nby Lestrade.\n\nThere is nothing like first hand evidence, he remarked; as a matter of\nfact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well\nlearn all that is to be learned.\n\nYou amaze me, Holmes, said I. Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to\nbe of all those particulars which you gave.\n\nTheres no room for a mistake, he answered. The very first thing which I\nobserved on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels\nclose to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so\nthat those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there\nduring the night. There were the marks of the horses hoofs, too, the outline\nof one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing\nthat that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and\nwas not there at any time during the morningI have Gregsons word for thatit\nfollows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it\nbrought those two individuals to the house.\n\nThat seems simple enough, said I; but how about the other mans height?\n\nWhy, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the\nlength of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no\nuse my boring you with figures. I had this fellows stride both on the clay\noutside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation.\nWhen a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads him to write about the level\nof his own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It\nwas childs play.\n\nAnd his age? I asked.\n\nWell, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort,\nhe cant be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth of a puddle on\nthe garden walk which he had evidently walked across. Patent-leather boots had\ngone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at\nall. I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of\nobservation and deduction which I advocated in that article. Is there anything\nelse that puzzles you?\n\nThe finger nails and the Trichinopoly, I suggested.\n\nThe writing on the wall was done with a mans forefinger dipped in blood. My\nglass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing\nit, which would not have been the case if the mans nail had been trimmed. I\ngathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and\nflakeysuch an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly. I have made a special\nstudy of cigar ashesin fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. I\nflatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand,\neither of cigar or of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled\ndetective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\n\nAnd the florid face? I asked.\n\nAh, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right. You\nmust not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\n\nI passed my hand over my brow. My head is in a whirl, I remarked; the more\none thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two menif there\nwere two meninto an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove\nthem? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood\ncome from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in\nit? How came the womans ring there? Above all, why should the second man\nwrite up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see\nany possible way of reconciling all these facts.\n\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\n\nYou sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well, he said.\nThere is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on\nthe main facts. As to poor Lestrades discovery it was simply a blind intended\nto put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret\nsocieties. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed\nsomewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the\nLatin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one,\nbut by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert\ninquiry into a wrong channel. Im not going to tell you much more of the case,\nDoctor. You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his\ntrick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to\nthe conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\n\nI shall never do that, I answered; you have brought detection as near an\nexact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\n\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in\nwhich I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to\nflattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\n\nIll tell you one other thing, he said. Patent leathers 10 and Square-toes\ncame in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as\npossiblearm-in-arm, in all probability. When they got inside they walked up\nand down the roomor rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes\nwalked up and down. I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that\nas he walked he grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased\nlength of his strides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up,\nno doubt, into a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. Ive told you all I know\nmyself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good\nworking basis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go\nto Halles concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\n\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the dingiest\nand dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand. Thats Audley\nCourt in there, he said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-\ncoloured brick. Youll find me here when you come back.\n\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a\nquadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We picked our way\namong groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until\nwe came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of\nbrass on which the name Rance was engraved. On enquiry we found that the\nconstable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await\nhis coming.\n\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his\nslumbers. I made my report at the office, he said.\n\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it pensively. We\nthought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips, he said.\n\nI shall be most happy to tell you anything I can, the constable answered\nwith his eyes upon the little golden disk.\n\nJust let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\n\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\n\nIll tell it ye from the beginning, he said. My time is from ten at night\nto six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the White Hart; but\nbar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one oclock it began to rain,\nand I met Harry Murcherhim who has the Holland Grove beatand we stood\ntogether at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin. Presentlymaybe about\ntwo or a little afterI thought I would take a look round and see that all was\nright down the Brixton Road. It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did\nI meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin\ndown, thinkin between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would\nbe, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that\nsame house. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on\naccount of him that owns them who wont have the drains seen to, though the\nvery last tenant what lived in one of them died o typhoid fever. I was\nknocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I\nsuspected as something was wrong. When I got to the door\n\nYou stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate, my companion\ninterrupted. What did you do that for?\n\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\namazement upon his features.\n\nWhy, thats true, sir, he said; though how you come to know it, Heaven only\nknows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome, that\nI thought Id be none the worse for some one with me. I aint afeared of\nanything on this side o the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him that\ndied o the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him. The thought gave me\na kind o turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murchers\nlantern, but there wasnt no sign of him nor of anyone else.\n\nThere was no one in the street?\n\nNot a livin soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together\nand went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside, so I went into\nthe room where the light was a-burnin. There was a candle flickerin on the\nmantelpiecea red wax oneand by its light I saw\n\nYes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times, and\nyou knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen\ndoor, and then\n\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his\neyes. Where was you hid to see all that? he cried. It seems to me that you\nknows a deal more than you should.\n\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable. Dont\nget arresting me for the murder, he said. I am one of the hounds and not the\nwolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though. What\ndid you do next?\n\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression. I\nwent back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher and two\nmore to the spot.\n\nWas the street empty then?\n\nWell, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nThe constables features broadened into a grin. Ive seen many a drunk chap\nin my time, he said, but never anyone so cryin drunk as that cove. He was\nat the gate when I came out, a-leanin up agin the railings, and a-singin at\nthe pitch o his lungs about Columbines New-fangled Banner, or some such\nstuff. He couldnt stand, far less help.\n\nWhat sort of a man was he? asked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. He was an\nuncommon drunk sort o man, he said. Hed ha found hisself in the station\nif we hadnt been so took up.\n\nHis facehis dressdidnt you notice them? Holmes broke in impatiently.\n\nI should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him upme and\nMurcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part\nmuffled round\n\nThat will do, cried Holmes. What became of him?\n\nWed enough to do without lookin after him, the policeman said, in an\naggrieved voice. Ill wager he found his way home all right.\n\nHow was he dressed?\n\nA brown overcoat.\n\nHad he a whip in his hand?\n\nA whipno.\n\nHe must have left it behind, muttered my companion. You didnt happen to\nsee or hear a cab after that?\n\nNo.\n\nTheres a half-sovereign for you, my companion said, standing up and taking\nhis hat. I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force. That head\nof yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your\nsergeants stripes last night. The man whom you held in your hands is the man\nwho holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking. There is no use\nof arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor.\n\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but\nobviously uncomfortable.\n\nThe blundering fool, Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\nlodgings. Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good luck,\nand not taking advantage of it.\n\nI am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this man\ntallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why should he\ncome back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way of criminals.\n\nThe ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no other\nway of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I shall have\nhim, DoctorIll lay you two to one that I have him. I must thank you for it\nall. I might not have gone but for you, and so have missed the finest study I\never came across: a study in scarlet, eh? Why shouldnt we use a little art\njargon. Theres the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless\nskein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every\ninch of it. And now for lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her\nbowing are splendid. Whats that little thing of Chopins she plays so\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\n\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a lark\nwhile I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR.\n\nOUR mornings exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired\nout in the afternoon. After Holmes departure for the concert, I lay down upon\nthe sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours sleep. It was a useless\nattempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the\nstrangest fancies and surmises crowded into it. Every time that I closed my\neyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered\nman. So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that\nI found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed\nits owner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland.\nStill I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the\nvictim was no condonment 11 in the eyes of the law.\n\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companions hypothesis,\nthat the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he had sniffed his\nlips, and had no doubt that he had detected something which had given rise to\nthe idea. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the mans death, since\nthere was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand,\nwhose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs\nof a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded\nan antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep\nwould be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident\nmanner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained all\nthe facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.\n\nHe was very late in returningso late, that I knew that the concert could not\nhave detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before he appeared.\n\nIt was magnificent, he said, as he took his seat. Do you remember what\nDarwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech\nwas arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There\nare vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in\nits childhood.\n\nThats rather a broad idea, I remarked.\n\nOnes ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature, he\nanswered. Whats the matter? Youre not looking quite yourself. This Brixton\nRoad affair has upset you.\n\nTo tell the truth, it has, I said. I ought to be more case-hardened after\nmy Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand\nwithout losing my nerve.\n\nI can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you seen\nthe evening paper?\n\nNo.\n\nIt gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the fact\nthat when the man was raised up, a womans wedding ring fell upon the floor.\nIt is just as well it does not.\n\nWhy?\n\nLook at this advertisement, he answered. I had one sent to every paper this\nmorning immediately after the affair.\n\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It was\nthe first announcement in the Found column. In Brixton Road, this morning,\nit ran, a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the White\nHart Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson, 221B, Baker Street, between\neight and nine this evening.\n\nExcuse my using your name, he said. If I used my own some of these\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\n\nThat is all right, I answered. But supposing anyone applies, I have no\nring.\n\nOh yes, you have, said he, handing me one. This will do very well. It is\nalmost a facsimile.\n\nAnd who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\n\nWhy, the man in the brown coatour florid friend with the square toes. If he\ndoes not come himself he will send an accomplice.\n\nWould he not consider it as too dangerous?\n\nNot at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to\nbelieve that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring.\nAccording to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebbers body, and\ndid not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he discovered his loss\nand hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his own\nfolly in leaving the candle burning. He had to pretend to be drunk in order to\nallay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his appearance at the\ngate. Now put yourself in that mans place. On thinking the matter over, it\nmust have occurred to him that it was possible that he had lost the ring in\nthe road after leaving the house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly\nlook out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles\nfound. His eye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why\nshould he fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding of\nthe ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will come. You\nshall see him within an hour?\n\nAnd then? I asked.\n\nOh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\n\nI have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\n\nYou had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man, and though I\nshall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.\n\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with the pistol\nthe table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his favourite occupation\nof scraping upon his violin.\n\nThe plot thickens, he said, as I entered; I have just had an answer to my\nAmerican telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\n\nAnd that is? I asked eagerly.\n\nMy fiddle would be the better for new strings, he remarked. Put your pistol\nin your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary way. Leave\nthe rest to me. Dont frighten him by looking at him too hard.\n\nIt is eight oclock now, I said, glancing at my watch.\n\nYes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly. That\nwill do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a queer old book I\npicked up at a stall yesterdayDe Jure inter Gentespublished in Latin at\nLiege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles head was still firm on his shoulders\nwhen this little brown-backed volume was struck off.\n\nWho is the printer?\n\nPhilippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very faded\nink, is written Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte. I wonder who William Whyte was.\nSome pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His writing has a\nlegal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\n\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose softly\nand moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the servant pass\nalong the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she opened it.\n\nDoes Dr. Watson live here? asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could\nnot hear the servants reply, but the door closed, and some one began to\nascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of\nsurprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came\nslowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door.\n\nCome in, I cried.\n\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and\nwrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be dazzled by the\nsudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she stood blinking at us\nwith her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket with nervous, shaky fingers.\nI glanced at my companion, and his face had assumed such a disconsolate\nexpression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.\n\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement.\nIts this as has brought me, good gentlemen, she said, dropping another\ncurtsey; a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It belongs to my girl\nSally, as was married only this time twelvemonth, which her husband is steward\naboard a Union boat, and what hed say if he come ome and found her without\nher ring is more than I can think, he being short enough at the best o times,\nbut more especially when he has the drink. If it please you, she went to the\ncircus last night along with\n\nIs that her ring? I asked.\n\nThe Lord be thanked! cried the old woman; Sally will be a glad woman this\nnight. Thats the ring.\n\nAnd what may your address be? I inquired, taking up a pencil.\n\n13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\n\nThe Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch, said\nSherlock Holmes sharply.\n\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little red-rimmed\neyes. The gentleman asked me for _my_ address, she said. Sally lives in\nlodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\n\nAnd your name is?\n\nMy name is Sawyerhers is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married herand a smart,\nclean lad, too, as long as hes at sea, and no steward in the company more\nthought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what with liquor\nshops\n\nHere is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer, I interrupted, in obedience to a sign from\nmy companion; it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad to be able\nto restore it to the rightful owner.\n\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone\npacked it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock\nHolmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into his\nroom. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and a cravat. Ill\nfollow her, he said, hurriedly; she must be an accomplice, and will lead me\nto him. Wait up for me. The hall door had hardly slammed behind our visitor\nbefore Holmes had descended the stair. Looking through the window I could see\nher walking feebly along the other side, while her pursuer dogged her some\nlittle distance behind. Either his whole theory is incorrect, I thought to\nmyself, or else he will be led now to the heart of the mystery. There was no\nneed for him to ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was\nimpossible until I heard the result of his adventure.\n\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might be,\nbut I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages of Henri\nMurgers Vie de Bohme. Ten oclock passed, and I heard the footsteps of the\nmaid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the more stately tread of the\nlandlady passed my door, bound for the same destination. It was close upon\ntwelve before I heard the sharp sound of his latch-key. The instant he entered\nI saw by his face that he had not been successful. Amusement and chagrin\nseemed to be struggling for the mastery, until the former suddenly carried the\nday, and he burst into a hearty laugh.\n\nI wouldnt have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world, he cried,\ndropping into his chair; I have chaffed them so much that they would never\nhave let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I know that I\nwill be even with them in the long run.\n\nWhat is it then? I asked.\n\nOh, I dont mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a\nlittle way when she began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore.\nPresently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. I\nmanaged to be close to her so as to hear the address, but I need not have been\nso anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of\nthe street, Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch, she cried. This begins\nto look genuine, I thought, and having seen her safely inside, I perched\nmyself behind. Thats an art which every detective should be an expert at.\nWell, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in\nquestion. I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the\nstreet in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped\ndown, and I saw him open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out\nthough. When I reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab,\nand giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I\nlistened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it will\nbe some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13 we found that\nthe house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no\none of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.\n\nYou dont mean to say, I cried, in amazement, that that tottering, feeble\nold woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without\neither you or the driver seeing her?\n\nOld woman be damned! said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. We were the old women\nto be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too,\nbesides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was inimitable. He saw that he\nwas followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip. It shows\nthat the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he was, but has\nfriends who are ready to risk something for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking\ndone-up. Take my advice and turn in.\n\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I left Holmes\nseated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the\nnight I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin, and knew that he was\nstill pondering over the strange problem which he had set himself to unravel.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE CAN DO.\n\nTHE papers next day were full of the Brixton Mystery, as they termed it.\nEach had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in\naddition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I still\nretain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case.\nHere is a condensation of a few of them:\n\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom\nbeen a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the\nvictim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the\nwall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and\nrevolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased\nhad, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them.\nAfter alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the\nMarchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus,\nand the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the\nGovernment and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.\n\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all\nauthority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for\nsome weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame\nCharpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He was accompanied in his travels\nby his private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The two bade adieu to their\nlandlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the\navowed intention of catching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen\ntogether upon the platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebbers\nbody was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many\nmiles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are questions\nwhich are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the whereabouts of\nStangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of\nScotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently\nanticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the\nmatter.\n\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a\npolitical one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the\nContinental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number\nof men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the\nrecollection of all that they had undergone. Among these men there was a\nstringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death.\nEvery effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to\nascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased. A great step had\nbeen gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he had\nboardeda result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr.\nGregson of Scotland Yard.\n\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they\nappeared to afford him considerable amusement.\n\nI told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to\nscore.\n\nThat depends on how it turns out.\n\nOh, bless you, it doesnt matter in the least. If the man is caught, it will\nbe _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in spite_ of\ntheir exertions. Its heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they\nwill have followers. Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui ladmire.\n\nWhat on earth is this? I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering\nof many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible\nexpressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\n\nIts the Baker Street division of the detective police force, said my\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of\nthe dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.\n\nTention! cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels\nstood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. In future you shall\nsend up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street.\nHave you found it, Wiggins?\n\nNo, sir, we haint, said one of the youths.\n\nI hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are your\nwages. 13 He handed each of them a shilling.\n\nNow, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\n\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and\nwe heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\n\nTheres more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a\ndozen of the force, Holmes remarked. The mere sight of an official-looking\nperson seals mens lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear\neverything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation.\n\nIs it on this Brixton case that you are employing them? I asked.\n\nYes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of\ntime. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is\nGregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his\nface. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he is!\n\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired\ndetective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our\nsitting-room.\n\nMy dear fellow, he cried, wringing Holmes unresponsive hand, congratulate\nme! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\n\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companions expressive face.\n\nDo you mean that you are on the right track? he asked.\n\nThe right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\n\nAnd his name is?\n\nArthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majestys navy, cried Gregson,\npompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\n\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\n\nTake a seat, and try one of these cigars, he said. We are anxious to know\nhow you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\n\nI dont mind if I do, the detective answered. The tremendous exertions\nwhich I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so\nmuch bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind. You will\nappreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.\n\nYou do me too much honour, said Holmes, gravely. Let us hear how you\narrived at this most gratifying result.\n\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his\ncigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of amusement.\n\nThe fun of it is, he cried, that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so\nsmart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is after the secretary\nStangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn. I have\nno doubt that he has caught him by this time.\n\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\n\nAnd how did you get your clue?\n\nAh, Ill tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly\nbetween ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the\nfinding of this Americans antecedents. Some people would have waited until\ntheir advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and\nvolunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregsons way of going to work.\nYou remember the hat beside the dead man?\n\nYes, said Holmes; by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\n\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\n\nI had no idea that you noticed that, he said. Have you been there?\n\nNo.\n\nHa! cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; you should never neglect a chance,\nhowever small it may seem.\n\nTo a great mind, nothing is little, remarked Holmes, sententiously.\n\nWell, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that size\nand description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once. He had sent\nthe hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentiers Boarding Establishment,\nTorquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\n\nSmartvery smart! murmured Sherlock Holmes.\n\nI next called upon Madame Charpentier, continued the detective. I found her\nvery pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room, tooan uncommonly fine\ngirl she is, too; she was looking red about the eyes and her lips trembled as\nI spoke to her. That didnt escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. You know\nthe feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scenta kind of\nthrill in your nerves. Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late\nboarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland? I asked.\n\nThe mother nodded. She didnt seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst\ninto tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the\nmatter.\n\nAt what oclock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train? I asked.\n\nAt eight oclock, she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\nagitation. His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trainsone\nat 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. 14\n\nAnd was that the last which you saw of him?\n\nA terrible change came over the womans face as I asked the question. Her\nfeatures turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she could get out\nthe single word Yesand when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone.\n\nThere was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear\nvoice.\n\nNo good can ever come of falsehood, mother, she said. Let us be frank with\nthis gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.\n\nGod forgive you! cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\nsinking back in her chair. You have murdered your brother.\n\nArthur would rather that we spoke the truth, the girl answered firmly.\n\nYou had best tell me all about it now, I said. Half-confidences are worse\nthan none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.\n\nOn your head be it, Alice! cried her mother; and then, turning to me, I\nwill tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son\narises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this terrible affair.\nHe is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in\nthe eyes of others he may appear to be compromised. That however is surely\nimpossible. His high character, his profession, his antecedents would all\nforbid it.\n\nYour best way is to make a clean breast of the facts, I answered. Depend\nupon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.\n\nPerhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together, she said, and her\ndaughter withdrew. Now, sir, she continued, I had no intention of telling\nyou all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no\nalternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without\nomitting any particular.\n\nIt is your wisest course, said I.\n\nMr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary, Mr.\nStangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a Copenhagen\nlabel upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last\nstopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his employer, I am\nsorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his habits and brutish in\nhis ways. The very night of his arrival he became very much the worse for\ndrink, and, indeed, after twelve oclock in the day he could hardly ever be\nsaid to be sober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\nand familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude towards my\ndaughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way which, fortunately,\nshe is too innocent to understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in\nhis arms and embraced heran outrage which caused his own secretary to\nreproach him for his unmanly conduct.\n\nBut why did you stand all this, I asked. I suppose that you can get rid of\nyour boarders when you wish.\n\nMrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. Would to God that I had\ngiven him notice on the very day that he came, she said. But it was a sore\ntemptation. They were paying a pound a day eachfourteen pounds a week, and\nthis is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me\nmuch. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best. This last was too\nmuch, however, and I gave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the\nreason of his going.\n\nWell?\n\nMy heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave just now,\nbut I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper is violent, and he\nis passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the door behind them a load\nseemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring\nat the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited,\nand evidently the worse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I\nwas sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having\nmissed his train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\nto her that she should fly with him. You are of age, he said, and there is\nno law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl\nhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a\nprincess. Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him, but he\ncaught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the door. I\nscreamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened\nthen I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was\ntoo terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in\nthe doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. I dont think that fine\nfellow will trouble us again, he said. I will just go after him and see what\nhe does with himself. With those words he took his hat and started off down\nthe street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebbers mysterious death.\n\nThis statement came from Mrs. Charpentiers lips with many gasps and pauses.\nAt times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I made\nshorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should be no\npossibility of a mistake.\n\nIts quite exciting, said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. What happened\nnext?\n\nWhen Mrs. Charpentier paused, the detective continued, I saw that the whole\ncase hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which I always found\neffective with women, I asked her at what hour her son returned.\n\nI do not know, she answered.\n\nNot know?\n\nNo; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.\n\nAfter you went to bed?\n\nYes.\n\nWhen did you go to bed?\n\nAbout eleven.\n\nSo your son was gone at least two hours?\n\nYes.\n\nPossibly four or five?\n\nYes.\n\nWhat was he doing during that time?\n\nI do not know, she answered, turning white to her very lips.\n\nOf course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where\nLieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him. When\nI touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come quietly with us, he\nanswered us as bold as brass, I suppose you are arresting me for being\nconcerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber, he said. We had said\nnothing to him about it, so that his alluding to it had a most suspicious\naspect.\n\nVery, said Holmes.\n\nHe still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as having\nwith him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\n\nWhat is your theory, then?\n\nWell, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road. When\nthere, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber\nreceived a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which\nkilled him without leaving any mark. The night was so wet that no one was\nabout, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim into the empty house. As\nto the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they\nmay all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.\n\nWell done! said Holmes in an encouraging voice. Really, Gregson, you are\ngetting along. We shall make something of you yet.\n\nI flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly, the detective\nanswered proudly. The young man volunteered a statement, in which he said\nthat after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him, and took a\ncab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an old shipmate, and\ntook a long walk with him. On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he\nwas unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits\ntogether uncommonly well. What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had\nstarted off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he wont make much of 15 Why, by\nJove, heres the very man himself!\n\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and\nwho now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked\nhis demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His face was disturbed and\ntroubled, while his clothes were disarranged and untidy. He had evidently come\nwith the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his\ncolleague he appeared to be embarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of\nthe room, fumbling nervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. This is a\nmost extraordinary case, he said at lasta most incomprehensible affair.\n\nAh, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade! cried Gregson, triumphantly. I thought\nyou would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr.\nJoseph Stangerson?\n\nThe Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson, said Lestrade gravely, was murdered\nat Hallidays Private Hotel about six oclock this morning.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VII. LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS.\n\nTHE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang out of\nhis chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I stared in\nsilence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn\ndown over his eyes.\n\nStangerson too! he muttered. The plot thickens.\n\nIt was quite thick enough before, grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair. I seem\nto have dropped into a sort of council of war.\n\nAre youare you sure of this piece of intelligence? stammered Gregson.\n\nI have just come from his room, said Lestrade. I was the first to discover\nwhat had occurred.\n\nWe have been hearing Gregsons view of the matter, Holmes observed. Would\nyou mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\n\nI have no objection, Lestrade answered, seating himself. I freely confess\nthat I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of\nDrebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken.\nFull of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the\nSecretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight\non the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in\nthe Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how\nStangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what\nhad become of him afterwards. I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description\nof the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then\nset to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of\nEuston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become\nseparated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in\nthe vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next\nmorning.\n\nThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand, remarked\nHolmes.\n\nSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries\nentirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight oclock\nI reached Hallidays Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as\nto whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the\naffirmative.\n\nNo doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting, they said. He has\nbeen waiting for a gentleman for two days.\n\nWhere is he now? I asked.\n\nHe is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\n\nI will go up and see him at once, I said.\n\nIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him\nto say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was\non the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it. The\nBoots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I\nsaw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years\nexperience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood,\nwhich had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the\nskirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He\nnearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put\nour shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and\nbeside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He\nwas quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold.\nWhen we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same\ngentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The\ncause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated\nthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose\nwas above the murdered man?\n\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even\nbefore Sherlock Holmes answered.\n\nThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood, he said.\n\nThat was it, said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent\nfor a while.\n\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of\nthis unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My\nnerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought\nof it.\n\nThe man was seen, continued Lestrade. A milk boy, passing on his way to the\ndairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of\nthe hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised\nagainst one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After\npassing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so\nquietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at\nwork in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his\nown mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that\nthe man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish\ncoat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for\nwe found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and\nmarks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\n\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied\nso exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of exultation or\nsatisfaction upon his face.\n\nDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?\nhe asked.\n\nNothing. Stangerson had Drebbers purse in his pocket, but it seems that this\nwas usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but\nnothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes,\nrobbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the\nmurdered mans pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a\nmonth ago, and containing the words, J. H. is in Europe. There was no name\nappended to this message.\n\nAnd there was nothing else? Holmes asked.\n\nNothing of any importance. The mans novel, with which he had read himself to\nsleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair beside him. There\nwas a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip\nointment box containing a couple of pills.\n\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\n\nThe last link, he cried, exultantly. My case is complete.\n\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\n\nI have now in my hands, my companion said, confidently, all the threads\nwhich have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details to be filled\nin, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber\nparted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the\nlatter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes. I will give you a proof of my\nknowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?\n\nI have them, said Lestrade, producing a small white box; I took them and\nthe purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at\nthe Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am\nbound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.\n\nGive them here, said Holmes. Now, Doctor, turning to me, are those\nordinary pills?\n\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and\nalmost transparent against the light. From their lightness and transparency,\nI should imagine that they are soluble in water, I remarked.\n\nPrecisely so, answered Holmes. Now would you mind going down and fetching\nthat poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the\nlandlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\n\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. Its laboured\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its\nsnow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of\ncanine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.\n\nI will now cut one of these pills in two, said Holmes, and drawing his\npenknife he suited the action to the word. One half we return into the box\nfor future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which\nis a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right,\nand that it readily dissolves.\n\nThis may be very interesting, said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who\nsuspects that he is being laughed at, I cannot see, however, what it has to\ndo with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\n\nPatience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything\nto do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable,\nand on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.\n\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed\nit in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock Holmes\nearnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching\nthe animal intently, and expecting some startling effect. None such appeared,\nhowever. The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho 16 cushion, breathing in\na laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its\ndraught.\n\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result,\nan expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his\nfeatures. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed\nevery other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt\nsincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no\nmeans displeased at this check which he had met.\n\nIt cant be a coincidence, he cried, at last springing from his chair and\npacing wildly up and down the room; it is impossible that it should be a mere\ncoincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are\nactually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert. What can\nit mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is\nimpossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it! I have\nit! With a perfect shriek of delight he rushed to the box, cut the other pill\nin two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier. The\nunfortunate creatures tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it\nbefore it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and\nlifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.\n\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\nforehead. I should have more faith, he said; I ought to know by this time\nthat when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it\ninvariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation. Of the\ntwo pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was\nentirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at\nall.\n\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly\nbelieve that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog, however, to\nprove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me that the mists in\nmy own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague\nperception of the truth.\n\nAll this seems strange to you, continued Holmes, because you failed at the\nbeginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which\nwas presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and\neverything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original\nsupposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it. Hence things which\nhave perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me\nand to strengthen my conclusions. It is a mistake to confound strangeness with\nmystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it\npresents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This\nmurder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those _outr_\nand sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These\nstrange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the\neffect of making it less so.\n\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience,\ncould contain himself no longer. Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, he said,\nwe are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have\nyour own methods of working. We want something more than mere theory and\npreaching now, though. It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case\nout, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged\nin this second affair. Lestrade went after his man, Stangerson, and it appears\nthat he was wrong too. You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and\nseem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have\na right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name\nthe man who did it?\n\nI cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir, remarked Lestrade. We\nhave both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more than once\nsince I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require.\nSurely you will not withhold it any longer.\n\nAny delay in arresting the assassin, I observed, might give him time to\nperpetrate some fresh atrocity.\n\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He continued to\nwalk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest and his brows drawn\ndown, as was his habit when lost in thought.\n\nThere will be no more murders, he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing\nus. You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if\nI know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small\nthing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him. This I\nexpect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own\narrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a\nshrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had\noccasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself. As long as this man\nhas no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him;\nbut if he had the slightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in\nan instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without\nmeaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider\nthese men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I\nhave not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the\nblame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present I am ready\nto promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without\nendangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\n\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by\nthe depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had flushed up\nto the roots of his flaxen hair, while the others beady eyes glistened with\ncuriosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to speak, however, before\nthere was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young\nWiggins, introduced his insignificant and unsavoury person.\n\nPlease, sir, he said, touching his forelock, I have the cab downstairs.\n\nGood boy, said Holmes, blandly. Why dont you introduce this pattern at\nScotland Yard? he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer.\nSee how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.\n\nThe old pattern is good enough, remarked Lestrade, if we can only find the\nman to put them on.\n\nVery good, very good, said Holmes, smiling. The cabman may as well help me\nwith my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\n\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about to set\nout on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it. There was a\nsmall portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and began to strap. He\nwas busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.\n\nJust give me a help with this buckle, cabman, he said, kneeling over his\ntask, and never turning his head.\n\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his\nhands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of\nmetal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\n\nGentlemen, he cried, with flashing eyes, let me introduce you to Mr.\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.\n\nThe whole thing occurred in a momentso quickly that I had no time to realize\nit. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes triumphant\nexpression and the ring of his voice, of the cabmans dazed, savage face, as\nhe glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon\nhis wrists. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues. Then,\nwith an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from\nHolmess grasp, and hurled himself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave\nway before him; but before he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes\nsprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room,\nand then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that\nthe four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the\nconvulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands were\nterribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no\neffect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until Lestrade succeeded in\ngetting his hand inside his neckcloth and half-strangling him that we made him\nrealize that his struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security\nuntil we had pinioned his feet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our\nfeet breathless and panting.\n\nWe have his cab, said Sherlock Holmes. It will serve to take him to\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen, he continued, with a pleasant smile, we\nhave reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to put any\nquestions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse\nto answer them.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  PART II. _The Country of the Saints._\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.\n\nIN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an\narid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier\nagainst the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and\nfrom the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a\nregion of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout\nthis grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and\ngloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged\ncaons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow,\nand in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve,\nhowever, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\n\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees or of\nBlackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-\ngrounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those\nawesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies. The\ncoyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and\nthe clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such\nsustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These are the sole dwellers in the\nwilderness.\n\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the\nnorthern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach stretches the\ngreat flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected\nby clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On the extreme verge of the\nhorizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked\nwith snow. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of\nanything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no\nmovement upon the dull, grey earthabove all, there is absolute silence.\nListen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty\nwilderness; nothing but silencecomplete and heart-subduing silence.\n\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain.\nThat is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway\ntraced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme\ndistance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many\nadventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in\nthe sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach, and\nexamine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more\ndelicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen\nhundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered\nremains of those who had fallen by the wayside.\n\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen\nhundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance was such that he\nmight have been the very genius or demon of the region. An observer would have\nfound it difficult to say whether he was nearer to forty or to sixty. His face\nwas lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over\nthe projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and\ndashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an\nunnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more\nfleshy than that of a skeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for\nsupport, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones\nsuggested a wiry and vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his\nclothes, which hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it\nwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was dyingdying\nfrom hunger and from thirst.\n\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in\nthe vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great salt plain\nstretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a\nsign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture.\nIn all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. North, and east, and\nwest he looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he realised that his\nwanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was\nabout to die. Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\nhe muttered, as he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\n\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle, and\nalso a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried slung over\nhis right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his strength, for\nin lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence.\nInstantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it\nthere protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two\nlittle speckled, dimpled fists.\n\nYouve hurt me! said a childish voice reproachfully.\n\nHave I though, the man answered penitently, I didnt go for to do it. As\nhe spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of\nabout five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its\nlittle linen apron all bespoke a mothers care. The child was pale and wan,\nbut her healthy arms and legs showed that she had suffered less than her\ncompanion.\n\nHow is it now? he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the towsy\ngolden curls which covered the back of her head.\n\nKiss it and make it well, she said, with perfect gravity, shoving 19 the\ninjured part up to him. Thats what mother used to do. Wheres mother?\n\nMothers gone. I guess youll see her before long.\n\nGone, eh! said the little girl. Funny, she didnt say good-bye; she most\nalways did if she was just goin over to Aunties for tea, and now shes been\naway three days. Say, its awful dry, aint it? Aint there no water, nor\nnothing to eat?\n\nNo, there aint nothing, dearie. Youll just need to be patient awhile, and\nthen youll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and then youll\nfeel bullier. It aint easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I\nguess Id best let you know how the cards lie. Whats that youve got?\n\nPretty things! fine things! cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding\nup two glittering fragments of mica. When we goes back to home Ill give them\nto brother Bob.\n\nYoull see prettier things than them soon, said the man confidently. You\njust wait a bit. I was going to tell you thoughyou remember when we left the\nriver?\n\nOh, yes.\n\nWell, we reckoned wed strike another river soon, dye see. But there was\nsomethin wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin, and it didnt turn up. Water\nran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you andand\n\nAnd you couldnt wash yourself, interrupted his companion gravely, staring\nup at his grimy visage.\n\nNo, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete,\nand then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.\n\nThen mothers a deader too, cried the little girl dropping her face in her\npinafore and sobbing bitterly.\n\nYes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some chance of\nwater in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it\ntogether. It dont seem as though weve improved matters. Theres an almighty\nsmall chance for us now!\n\nDo you mean that we are going to die too? asked the child, checking her\nsobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\n\nI guess thats about the size of it.\n\nWhy didnt you say so before? she said, laughing gleefully. You gave me\nsuch a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die well be with mother\nagain.\n\nYes, you will, dearie.\n\nAnd you too. Ill tell her how awful good youve been. Ill bet she meets us\nat the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat\ncakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of. How long\nwill it be first?\n\nI dont knownot very long. The mans eyes were fixed upon the northern\nhorizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little\nspecks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach.\nThey speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled\nover the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which\noverlooked them. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is\nthe forerunner of death.\n\nCocks and hens, cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-\nomened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. Say, did God make\nthis country?\n\nIn course He did, said her companion, rather startled by this unexpected\nquestion.\n\nHe made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri, the little\ngirl continued. I guess somebody else made the country in these parts. Its\nnot nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees.\n\nWhat would ye think of offering up prayer? the man asked diffidently.\n\nIt aint night yet, she answered.\n\nIt dont matter. It aint quite regular, but He wont mind that, you bet. You\nsay over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was\non the Plains.\n\nWhy dont you say some yourself? the child asked, with wondering eyes.\n\nI disremember them, he answered. I haint said none since I was half the\nheight o that gun. I guess its never too late. You say them out, and Ill\nstand by and come in on the choruses.\n\nThen youll need to kneel down, and me too, she said, laying the shawl out\nfor that purpose. Youve got to put your hands up like this. It makes you\nfeel kind o good.\n\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it.\nSide by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling\nchild and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face, and his haggard,\nangular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt\nentreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two\nvoicesthe one thin and clear, the other deep and harshunited in the entreaty\nfor mercy and forgiveness. The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the\nshadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad\nbreast of her protector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature\nproved to be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had\nallowed himself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the\ntired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the mans\ngrizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion, and both\nslept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\n\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would\nhave met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there\nrose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be\ndistinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and\nbroader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud. This cloud continued to\nincrease in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a\ngreat multitude of moving creatures. In more fertile spots the observer would\nhave come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which\ngraze upon the prairie land was approaching him. This was obviously impossible\nin these arid wilds. As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff\nupon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of\nwaggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze,\nand the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey\nfor the West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base of\nthe mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right across the\nenormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on\nhorseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who staggered along under\nburdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under\nthe white coverings. This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but\nrather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances\nto seek themselves a new country. There rose through the clear air a confused\nclattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of\nwheels and the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to\nrouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\n\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men,\nclad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching the base\nof the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.\n\nThe wells are to the right, my brothers, said one, a hard-lipped, clean-\nshaven man with grizzly hair.\n\nTo the right of the Sierra Blancoso we shall reach the Rio Grande, said\nanother.\n\nFear not for water, cried a third. He who could draw it from the rocks will\nnot now abandon His own chosen people.\n\nAmen! Amen! responded the whole party.\n\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-\neyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them. From\nits summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright\nagainst the grey rocks behind. At the sight there was a general reining up of\nhorses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to\nreinforce the vanguard. The word Redskins was on every lip.\n\nThere cant be any number of Injuns here, said the elderly man who appeared\nto be in command. We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes\nuntil we cross the great mountains.\n\nShall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson, asked one of the band.\n\nAnd I, and I, cried a dozen voices.\n\nLeave your horses below and we will await you here, the Elder answered. In a\nmoment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were\nascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited\ntheir curiosity. They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence\nand dexterity of practised scouts. The watchers from the plain below could see\nthem flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline.\nThe young man who had first given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his\nfollowers saw him throw up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment,\nand on joining him they were affected in the same way by the sight which met\ntheir eyes.\n\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant\nboulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-\nfeatured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid face and regular breathing\nshowed that he was fast asleep. Beside him lay a little child, with her round\nwhite arms encircling his brown sinewy neck, and her golden haired head\nresting upon the breast of his velveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted,\nshowing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile\nplayed over her infantile features. Her plump little white legs terminating in\nwhite socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to\nthe long shrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this\nstrange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new\ncomers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.\n\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about 20 them in\nbewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon the plain\nwhich had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now\ntraversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an\nexpression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his\neyes. This is what they call delirium, I guess, he muttered. The child stood\nbeside him, holding on to the skirt of his coat, and said nothing but looked\nall round her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.\n\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their\nappearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted\nher upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt companion, and\nassisted him towards the waggons.\n\nMy name is John Ferrier, the wanderer explained; me and that little un are\nall thats left o twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o thirst and\nhunger away down in the south.\n\nIs she your child? asked someone.\n\nI guess she is now, the other cried, defiantly; shes mine cause I saved\nher. No man will take her from me. Shes Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who\nare you, though? he continued, glancing with curiosity at his stalwart,\nsunburned rescuers; there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.\n\nNigh upon ten thousand, said one of the young men; we are the persecuted\nchildren of Godthe chosen of the Angel Merona.\n\nI never heard tell on him, said the wanderer. He appears to have chosen a\nfair crowd of ye.\n\nDo not jest at that which is sacred, said the other sternly. We are of\nthose who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on\nplates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at\nPalmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had\nfounded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and\nfrom the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.\n\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. I see,\nhe said, you are the Mormons.\n\nWe are the Mormons, answered his companions with one voice.\n\nAnd where are you going?\n\nWe do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with you.\n\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by\ncrowds of the pilgrimspale-faced meek-looking women, strong laughing\nchildren, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries of astonishment\nand of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of\none of the strangers and the destitution of the other. Their escort did not\nhalt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they\nreached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the\ngaudiness and smartness of its appearance. Six horses were yoked to it,\nwhereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside\nthe driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of\nage, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid it\naside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he turned\nto the two castaways.\n\nIf we take you with us, he said, in solemn words, it can only be as\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better far\nthat your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to\nbe that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit. Will you\ncome with us on these terms?\n\nGuess Ill come with you on any terms, said Ferrier, with such emphasis that\nthe grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader alone retained his\nstern, impressive expression.\n\nTake him, Brother Stangerson, he said, give him food and drink, and the\nchild likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy creed. We have\ndelayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\n\nOn, on to Zion! cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the\nlong caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull\nmurmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels\nthe great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding\nalong once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led\nthem to his waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.\n\nYou shall remain here, he said. In a few days you will have recovered from\nyour fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our\nreligion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with the voice of\nJoseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH.\n\nTHIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the\nimmigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the shores of\nthe Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had\nstruggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history. The savage man,\nand the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and diseaseevery impediment\nwhich Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon\ntenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the\nhearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his\nknees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the\nsunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was\nthe promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.\n\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city\nwas sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion\nto the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his trade and the\nartisan to his calling. In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by\nmagic. In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing,\nuntil the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop.\nEverything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple\nwhich they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.\nFrom the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of\nthe hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which\nthe immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\n\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the\nend of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly\nenough in Elder Stangersons waggon, a retreat which she shared with the\nMormons three wives and with his son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve.\nHaving rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her\nmothers death, she soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself\nto this new life in her moving canvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier\nhaving recovered from his privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide\nand an indefatigable hunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new\ncompanions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was\nunanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a\ntract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and\nof Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal\nElders.\n\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house,\nwhich received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy\nvilla. He was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his dealings and\nskilful with his hands. His iron constitution enabled him to work morning and\nevening at improving and tilling his lands. Hence it came about that his farm\nand all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was\nbetter off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich,\nand in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City\nwho could compare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\n\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities of\nhis co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him to set up\na female establishment after the manner of his companions. He never gave\nreasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and\ninflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some who accused him of\nlukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of\nwealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early\nlove affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the\nAtlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every\nother respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained\nthe name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man.\n\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in\nall his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of\nthe pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl. As year\nsucceeded to year she grew taller and stronger, her cheek more rudy, and her\nstep more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferriers\nfarm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her\nlithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon\nher fathers mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true\nchild of the West. So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw\nher father the richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\n\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious change\nis too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of all does the\nmaiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets\nher heart thrilling within her, and she learns, with a mixture of pride and of\nfear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her. There are few who\ncannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the\ndawn of a new life. In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious\nenough in itself, apart from its future influence on her destiny and that of\nmany besides.\n\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees\nwhose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and in the streets\nrose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high roads defiled long\nstreams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever\nhad broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of\nthe Elect. There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the\noutlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally\nweary of their interminable journey. Through all this motley assemblage,\nthreading her way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy\nFerrier, her fair face flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair\nfloating out behind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and\nwas dashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness\nof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even the\nunemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their\naccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.\n\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road blocked by a\ngreat drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the\nplains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her\nhorse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely had she got fairly into it,\nhowever, before the beasts closed in behind her, and she found herself\ncompletely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks.\nAccustomed as she was to deal with cattle, she was not alarmed at her\nsituation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her horse on in the\nhopes of pushing her way through the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one\nof the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with\nthe flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared\nup upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way\nthat would have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full\nof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could do to\nkeep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the\nhoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to sudden\nemergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax.\nChoked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling\ncreatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair, but for a kindly\nvoice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At the same moment a\nsinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way\nthrough the drove, soon brought her to the outskirts.\n\nYoure not hurt, I hope, miss, said her preserver, respectfully.\n\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. Im awful\nfrightened, she said, naively; whoever would have thought that Poncho would\nhave been so scared by a lot of cows?\n\nThank God you kept your seat, the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the\nrough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his shoulders. I guess\nyou are the daughter of John Ferrier, he remarked, I saw you ride down from\nhis house. When you see him, ask him if he remembers the Jefferson Hopes of\nSt. Louis. If hes the same Ferrier, my father and he were pretty thick.\n\nHadnt you better come and ask yourself? she asked, demurely.\n\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes sparkled\nwith pleasure. Ill do so, he said, weve been in the mountains for two\nmonths, and are not over and above in visiting condition. He must take us as\nhe finds us.\n\nHe has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I, she answered, hes\nawful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me hed have never got over it.\n\nNeither would I, said her companion.\n\nYou! Well, I dont see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You\naint even a friend of ours.\n\nThe young hunters dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier\nlaughed aloud.\n\nThere, I didnt mean that, she said; of course, you are a friend now. You\nmust come and see us. Now I must push along, or father wont trust me with his\nbusiness any more. Good-bye!\n\nGood-bye, he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over her\nlittle hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her riding-\nwhip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust.\n\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn. He and\nthey had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were\nreturning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some\nlodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen as any of them upon the\nbusiness until this sudden incident had drawn his thoughts into another\nchannel. The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the\nSierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths.\nWhen she had vanished from his sight, he realized that a crisis had come in\nhis life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could\never be of such importance to him as this new and all-absorbing one. The love\nwhich had sprung up in his heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a\nboy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious\ntemper. He had been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore\nin his heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human\nperseverance could render him successful.\n\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his face was\na familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed\nin his work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world\nduring the last twelve years. All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him,\nand in a style which interested Lucy as well as her father. He had been a\npioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made\nand fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a\ntrapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were\nto be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On such\noccasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright, happy eyes,\nshowed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer her own. Her honest\nfather may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not\nthrown away upon the man who had won her affections.\n\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled up at\nthe gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He threw the\nbridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\n\nI am off, Lucy, he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing tenderly\ndown into her face; I wont ask you to come with me now, but will you be\nready to come when I am here again?\n\nAnd when will that be? she asked, blushing and laughing.\n\nA couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\ndarling. Theres no one who can stand between us.\n\nAnd how about father? she asked.\n\nHe has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all right. I\nhave no fear on that head.\n\nOh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, theres no more\nto be said, she whispered, with her cheek against his broad breast.\n\nThank God! he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. It is settled,\nthen. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me\nat the caon. Good-bye, my own darlinggood-bye. In two months you shall see\nme.\n\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his horse,\ngalloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his\nresolution might fail him if he took one glance at what he was leaving. She\nstood at the gate, gazing after him until he vanished from her sight. Then she\nwalked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.\n\nTHREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had departed from\nSalt Lake City. John Ferriers heart was sore within him when he thought of\nthe young mans return, and of the impending loss of his adopted child. Yet\nher bright and happy face reconciled him to the arrangement more than any\nargument could have done. He had always determined, deep down in his resolute\nheart, that nothing would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a\nMormon. Such a marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and\na disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one\npoint he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for\nto express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the\nLand of the Saints.\n\nYes, a dangerous matterso dangerous that even the most saintly dared only\nwhisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell\nfrom their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon\nthem. The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own\naccount, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Not the Inquisition\nof Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy,\nwere ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which\ncast a cloud over the State of Utah.\n\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this\norganization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and\nyet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out against the Church\nvanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or what had befallen him. His\nwife and his children awaited him at home, but no father ever returned to tell\nthem how he had fared at the hands of his secret judges. A rash word or a\nhasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature\nmight be of this terrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that\nmen went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\n\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to\npervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The supply of\nadult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on\nwhich to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange rumours began to be\nbandied aboutrumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where\nIndians had never been seen. Fresh women appeared in the harems of the\nElderswomen who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an\nunextinguishable horror. Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs\nof armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the\ndarkness. These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were\ncorroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a\ndefinite name. To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the\nDanite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\n\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results\nserved to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the\nminds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. The names of\nthe participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of\nreligion were kept profoundly secret. The very friend to whom you communicated\nyour misgivings as to the Prophet and his mission, might be one of those who\nwould come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation.\nHence every man feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\nnearest his heart.\n\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields, when\nhe heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout,\nsandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His heart leapt to his\nmouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. Full of\ntrepidationfor he knew that such a visit boded him little goodFerrier ran to\nthe door to greet the Mormon chief. The latter, however, received his\nsalutations coldly, and followed him with a stern face into the sitting-room.\n\nBrother Ferrier, he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from\nunder his light-coloured eyelashes, the true believers have been good friends\nto you. We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our\nfood with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of\nland, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection. Is not this so?\n\nIt is so, answered John Ferrier.\n\nIn return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should\nembrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages. This you\npromised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.\n\nAnd how have I neglected it? asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\nexpostulation. Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended at\nthe Temple? Have I not?\n\nWhere are your wives? asked Young, looking round him. Call them in, that I\nmay greet them.\n\nIt is true that I have not married, Ferrier answered. But women were few,\nand there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a lonely man: I\nhad my daughter to attend to my wants.\n\nIt is of that daughter that I would speak to you, said the leader of the\nMormons. She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the\neyes of many who are high in the land.\n\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\n\nThere are stories of her which I would fain disbelievestories that she is\nsealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the\nthirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? Let every maiden of\nthe true faith marry one of the elect; for if she wed a Gentile, she commits a\ngrievous sin. This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy\ncreed, should suffer your daughter to violate it.\n\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his riding-whip.\n\nUpon this one point your whole faith shall be testedso it has been decided\nin the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would not have her\nwed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all choice. We Elders have\nmany heifers, 29 but our children must also be provided. Stangerson has a son,\nand Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter\nto their house. Let her choose between them. They are young and rich, and of\nthe true faith. What say you to that?\n\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\n\nYou will give us time, he said at last. My daughter is very youngshe is\nscarce of an age to marry.\n\nShe shall have a month to choose, said Young, rising from his seat. At the\nend of that time she shall give her answer.\n\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\nflashing eyes. It were better for you, John Ferrier, he thundered, that you\nand she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that\nyou should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!\n\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and Ferrier\nheard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\n\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he should\nbroach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his, and\nlooking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her pale, frightened\nface showed him that she had heard what had passed.\n\nI could not help it, she said, in answer to his look. His voice rang\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\n\nDont you scare yourself, he answered, drawing her to him, and passing his\nbroad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. Well fix it up somehow\nor another. You dont find your fancy kind o lessening for this chap, do\nyou?\n\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\n\nNo; of course not. I shouldnt care to hear you say you did. Hes a likely\nlad, and hes a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o all\ntheir praying and preaching. Theres a party starting for Nevada to-morrow,\nand Ill manage to send him a message letting him know the hole we are in. If\nI know anything o that young man, hell be back here with a speed that would\nwhip electro-telegraphs.\n\nLucy laughed through her tears at her fathers description.\n\nWhen he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that I am\nfrightened, dear. One hearsone hears such dreadful stories about those who\noppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them.\n\nBut we havent opposed him yet, her father answered. It will be time to\nlook out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at the end\nof that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\n\nLeave Utah!\n\nThats about the size of it.\n\nBut the farm?\n\nWe will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell the\ntruth, Lucy, it isnt the first time I have thought of doing it. I dont care\nabout knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet.\nIm a free-born American, and its all new to me. Guess Im too old to learn.\nIf he comes browsing about this farm, he might chance to run up against a\ncharge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.\n\nBut they wont let us leave, his daughter objected.\n\nWait till Jefferson comes, and well soon manage that. In the meantime, dont\nyou fret yourself, my dearie, and dont get your eyes swelled up, else hell\nbe walking into me when he sees you. Theres nothing to be afeared about, and\ntheres no danger at all.\n\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she\ncould not help observing that he paid unusual care to the fastening of the\ndoors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old\nshotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.\n\nON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet, John\nFerrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his acquaintance, who was\nbound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him with his message to Jefferson\nHope. In it he told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened\nthem, and how necessary it was that he should return. Having done thus he felt\neasier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.\n\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of\nthe posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering to find two\nyoung men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was\nleaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet cocked up upon the stove. The\nother, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front\nof the window with his hands in his pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of\nthem nodded to Ferrier as he entered, and the one in the rocking-chair\ncommenced the conversation.\n\nMaybe you dont know us, he said. This here is the son of Elder Drebber,\nand Im Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord\nstretched out His hand and gathered you into the true fold.\n\nAs He will all the nations in His own good time, said the other in a nasal\nvoice; He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\n\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\n\nWe have come, continued Stangerson, at the advice of our fathers to solicit\nthe hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her.\nAs I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me\nthat my claim is the stronger one.\n\nNay, nay, Brother Stangerson, cried the other; the question is not how many\nwives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now given over his\nmills to me, and I am the richer man.\n\nBut my prospects are better, said the other, warmly. When the Lord removes\nmy father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory. Then I am\nyour elder, and am higher in the Church.\n\nIt will be for the maiden to decide, rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his\nown reflection in the glass. We will leave it all to her decision.\n\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly\nable to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\n\nLook here, he said at last, striding up to them, when my daughter summons\nyou, you can come, but until then I dont want to see your faces again.\n\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\ncompetition between them for the maidens hand was the highest of honours both\nto her and her father.\n\nThere are two ways out of the room, cried Ferrier; there is the door, and\nthere is the window. Which do you care to use?\n\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening, that his\nvisitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The old farmer\nfollowed them to the door.\n\nLet me know when you have settled which it is to be, he said, sardonically.\n\nYou shall smart for this! Stangerson cried, white with rage. You have\ndefied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end of\nyour days.\n\nThe hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you, cried young Drebber; He will\narise and smite you!\n\nThen Ill start the smiting, exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have\nrushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and restrained\nhim. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses hoofs told him\nthat they were beyond his reach.\n\nThe young canting rascals! he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his\nforehead; I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of\neither of them.\n\nAnd so should I, father, she answered, with spirit; but Jefferson will soon\nbe here.\n\nYes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we do\nnot know what their next move may be.\n\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help\nshould come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted daughter. In\nthe whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank\ndisobedience to the authority of the Elders. If minor errors were punished so\nsternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his\nwealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as\nrich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over\nto the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy\nterrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip,\nbut this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the\nkeen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\n\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as\nto his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for\nmanner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise, a small square of\npaper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over his chest. On it was\nprinted, in bold straggling letters:\n\nTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then\n\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this\nwarning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept\nin an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured. He crumpled\nthe paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill\ninto his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month\nwhich Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an\nenemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin\nmight have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had\nslain him.\n\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast\nwhen Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling\nwas scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28\\. To his daughter\nit was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with\nhis gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the\nmorning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door.\n\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen\nenemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous\nposition how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace.\nSometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the\nfloors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or\nthe railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence\nthese daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came\nupon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes\nhad the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life\nnow, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\n\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the\nabsentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign\nof him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at\nhis team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at\nlast. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he\nlost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his\nlimited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew\nthat he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and\nguarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council.\nTurn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung\nover him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life\nitself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughters dishonour.\n\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the figure 2\nupon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted\ntime. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled\nhis imagination. And his daughterwhat was to become of her after he was gone?\nWas there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them.\nHe sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own\nimpotence.\n\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching soundlow, but very\ndistinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house.\nFerrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few\nmoments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently\ntapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight\nassassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret\ntribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace\nhad arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the\nsuspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he\ndrew the bolt and threw the door open.\n\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmers\neyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any\nhuman being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to\nleft, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his\nastonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and\nlegs all asprawl.\n\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his\nhand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first thought\nwas that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he\nwatched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the\nrapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the house the man sprang\nto his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce\nface and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.\n\nGood God! gasped John Ferrier. How you scared me! Whatever made you come in\nlike that.\n\nGive me food, the other said, hoarsely. I have had no time for bite or sup\nfor eight-and-forty hours. He flung himself upon the 21 cold meat and bread\nwhich were still lying upon the table from his hosts supper, and devoured it\nvoraciously. Does Lucy bear up well? he asked, when he had satisfied his\nhunger.\n\nYes. She does not know the danger, her father answered.\n\nThat is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled my\nway up to it. They may be darned sharp, but theyre not quite sharp enough to\ncatch a Washoe hunter.\n\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted\nally. He seized the young mans leathery hand and wrung it cordially. Youre\na man to be proud of, he said. There are not many who would come to share\nour danger and our troubles.\n\nYouve hit it there, pard, the young hunter answered. I have a respect for\nyou, but if you were alone in this business Id think twice before I put my\nhead into such a hornets nest. Its Lucy that brings me here, and before harm\ncomes on her I guess there will be one less o the Hope family in Utah.\n\nWhat are we to do?\n\nTo-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost. I have\na mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?\n\nTwo thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\n\nThat will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City\nthrough the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants\ndo not sleep in the house.\n\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching journey,\nJefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into a small parcel,\nand filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by experience that the\nmountain wells were few and far between. He had hardly completed his\narrangements before the farmer returned with his daughter all dressed and\nready for a start. The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for\nminutes were precious, and there was much to be done.\n\nWe must make our start at once, said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but\nresolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has\nsteeled his heart to meet it. The front and back entrances are watched, but\nwith caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields.\nOnce on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are\nwaiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.\n\nWhat if we are stopped, asked Ferrier.\n\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his tunic.\nIf they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us, he\nsaid with a sinister smile.\n\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened\nwindow Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own, and which he was\nnow about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved himself to the sacrifice,\nhowever, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his daughter\noutweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes. All looked so peaceful and\nhappy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it\nwas difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet\nthe white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his\napproach to the house he had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\n\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her\nmore valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they\nwaited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one\npassed through into the little garden. With bated breath and crouching figures\nthey stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they\nskirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields. They had\njust reached this point when the young man seized his two companions and\ndragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\n\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of\na lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy\nhooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was\nimmediately answered by another hoot at a small distance. At the same moment a\nvague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and\nuttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of\nthe obscurity.\n\nTo-morrow at midnight, said the first who appeared to be in authority. When\nthe Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\n\nIt is well, returned the other. Shall I tell Brother Drebber?\n\nPass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\n\nSeven to five! repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in\ndifferent directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of\nsign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died away in the\ndistance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his companions\nthrough the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his speed,\nsupporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength appeared to fail her.\n\nHurry on! hurry on! he gasped from time to time. We are through the line of\nsentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\n\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet\nanyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition.\nBefore reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow\nfootpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them\nthrough the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle\nCaon in which the horses were awaiting them. With unerring instinct Jefferson\nHope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up\nwatercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where\nthe faithful animals had been picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and\nold Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope\nled the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.\n\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in\nher wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or\nmore, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged\nsurface like the ribs of some petrified monster. On the other hand a wild\nchaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. Between the two ran\nthe irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian\nfile, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.\nYet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were\nlight within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the\nterrible despotism from which they were flying.\n\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction\nof the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of\nthe pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards. On a rock\nwhich overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there\nstood a solitary sentinel. He saw them as soon as they perceived him, and his\nmilitary challenge of Who goes there? rang through the silent ravine.\n\nTravellers for Nevada, said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the rifle\nwhich hung by his saddle.\n\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at them\nas if dissatisfied at their reply.\n\nBy whose permission? he asked.\n\nThe Holy Four, answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him that\nthat was the highest authority to which he could refer.\n\nNine from seven, cried the sentinel.\n\nSeven from five, returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\n\nPass, and the Lord go with you, said the voice from above. Beyond his post\nthe path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot. Looking\nback, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his gun, and knew that\nthey had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay\nbefore them.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS.\n\nALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and\nrock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hopes intimate\nknowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more. When\nmorning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In\nevery direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each\nothers shoulders to the far horizon. So steep were the rocky banks on either\nside of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their\nheads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor\nwas the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn\nwith trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they\npassed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the\nechoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.\n\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they\nwere all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of\nthe three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild torrent which swept\nout of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they\npartook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father would fain have rested\nlonger, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. They will be upon our track by\nthis time, he said. Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson\nwe may rest for the remainder of our lives.\n\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by\nevening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their\nenemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks\noffered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for\nwarmth, they enjoyed a few hours sleep. Before daybreak, however, they were\nup and on their way once more. They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and\nJefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the\nterrible organization whose enmity they had incurred. He little knew how far\nthat iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush\nthem.\n\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of\nprovisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however,\nfor there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before\nhad to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook,\nhe piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his\ncompanions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet\nabove the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen. Having tethered the\nhorses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out\nin search of whatever chance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the\nold man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three\nanimals stood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid\nthem from his view.\n\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At\nlast, after two or three hours fruitless search, he was thinking of turning\nback in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a\nthrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three\nor four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a\nsheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-hornfor\nso it is calledwas acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were\ninvisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite\ndirection, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle\nupon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The\nanimal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the\nprecipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.\n\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with\ncutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy over his\nshoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was already\ndrawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized the difficulty\nwhich faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which\nwere known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had\ntaken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many\ngorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish\none from the other. He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a\nmountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced\nthat he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result.\nNight was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found\nhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter\nto keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high\ncliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his\nburden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart\nby the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he\ncarried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their\njourney.\n\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them.\nEven in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which\nbounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had\nbeen absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands\nto his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he\nwas coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry,\nwhich clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears\nin countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again\nno whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago.\nA vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically,\ndropping the precious food in his agitation.\n\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire\nhad been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had\nevidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still\nreigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on.\nThere was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man,\nmaiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible\ndisaster had occurred during his absencea disaster which had embraced them\nall, and yet had left no traces behind it.\n\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round,\nand had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was\nessentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his\ntemporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to\nexamine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet of\nhorses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives,\nand the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back\nto Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of his companions with them?\nJefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when\nhis eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within\nhim. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish\nsoil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for\nanything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he\nperceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in\nthe cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the\npoint:\n\n    \n    \r\n                            JOHN FERRIER,\r\n                     FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, 22\r\n                        Died August 4th, 1860.\r\n    \n\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then,\nand this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if\nthere was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy had been carried\nback by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original destiny, by becoming\none of the harem of the Elders son. As the young fellow realized the\ncertainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that\nhe, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place.\n\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from\ndespair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his\nlife to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope\npossessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned\nfrom the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire,\nhe felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be\nthorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies.\nHis strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that\none end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had\ndropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough\nto last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he\nwas, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\navenging angels.\n\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had\nalready traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among the\nrocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was always\nwell on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Caon, from which they\nhad commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could look down upon the home\nof the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned upon his rifle and shook his\ngaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him. As he looked at\nit, he observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and\nother signs of festivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean\nwhen he heard the clatter of horses hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding\ntowards him. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to\nwhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted him\nwhen he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferriers fate\nhad been.\n\nI am Jefferson Hope, he said. You remember me.\n\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishmentindeed, it was\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white\nface and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days. Having,\nhowever, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity, the mans surprise\nchanged to consternation.\n\nYou are mad to come here, he cried. It is as much as my own life is worth\nto be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four\nfor assisting the Ferriers away.\n\nI dont fear them, or their warrant, Hope said, earnestly. You must know\nsomething of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to\nanswer a few questions. We have always been friends. For Gods sake, dont\nrefuse to answer me.\n\nWhat is it? the Mormon asked uneasily. Be quick. The very rocks have ears\nand the trees eyes.\n\nWhat has become of Lucy Ferrier?\n\nShe was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you have\nno life left in you.\n\nDont mind me, said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and had\nsunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. Married, you say?\n\nMarried yesterdaythats what those flags are for on the Endowment House.\nThere was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which\nwas to have her. Theyd both been in the party that followed them, and\nStangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but\nwhen they argued it out in council, Drebbers party was the stronger, so the\nProphet gave her over to him. No one wont have her very long though, for I\nsaw death in her face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are\nyou off, then?\n\nYes, I am off, said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His face\nmight have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression,\nwhile its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nNever mind, he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder, strode\noff down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts\nof the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous\nas himself.\n\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was the\nterrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which\nshe had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again, but pined away\nand died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had married her principally\nfor the sake of John Ferriers property, did not affect any great grief at his\nbereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with her the\nnight before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were grouped round the\nbier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and\nastonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten\nman in tattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to\nthe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had once\ncontained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his\nlips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he took\nthe wedding-ring from her finger. She shall not be buried in that, he cried\nwith a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the\nstairs and was gone. So strange and so brief was the episode, that the\nwatchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other\npeople of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold\nwhich marked her as having been a bride had disappeared.\n\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange\nwild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which\npossessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen\nprowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once\na bullet whistled through Stangersons window and flattened itself upon the\nwall within a foot of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a\ncliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible\ndeath by throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long\nin discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated\nexpeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their\nenemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the precaution of never\ngoing out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded. After\na time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or\nseen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his\nvindictiveness.\n\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunters mind was of\na hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such\ncomplete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He\nwas, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron\nconstitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon\nit. Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like\na dog among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet\nsuch a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that that was\nto play his enemys game, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines,\nthere to recruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue\nhis object without privation.\n\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of\nunforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five. At\nthe end of that time, however, his memory of his wrongs and his craving for\nrevenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he had stood by\nJohn Ferriers grave. Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to\nSalt Lake City, careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained\nwhat he knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There\nhad been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the\nyounger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the\nmalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been\nDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported\nthat Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money,\nand that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was\ncomparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their\nwhereabouts.\n\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in\nthe face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment.\nWith the small competence he possessed, eked out by such employment as he\ncould pick up, he travelled from town to town through the United States in\nquest of his enemies. Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled,\nbut still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon\nthe one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance\nwas rewarded. It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance\ntold him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of.\nHe returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all arranged.\nIt chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window, had recognized the\nvagrant in the street, and had read murder in his eyes. He hurried before a\njustice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his private\nsecretary, and represented to him that they were in danger of their lives from\nthe jealousy and hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken\ninto custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some\nweeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebbers house\nwas deserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\n\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred urged him\nto continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he had\nto return to work, saving every dollar for his approaching journey. At last,\nhaving collected enough to keep life in him, he departed for Europe, and\ntracked his enemies from city to city, working his way in any menial capacity,\nbut never overtaking the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had\ndeparted for Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had\njust set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days\nlate, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in\nrunning them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than\nquote the old hunters own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watsons Journal,\nto which we are already under such obligations.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VI. A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.\n\nOUR prisoners furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in\nhis disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he smiled\nin an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that he had not hurt any of us\nin the scuffle. I guess youre going to take me to the police-station, he\nremarked to Sherlock Holmes. My cabs at the door. If youll loose my legs\nIll walk down to it. Im not so light to lift as I used to be.\n\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition\nrather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his word, and\nloosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles. 23 He rose and\nstretched his legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more.\nI remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a\nmore powerfully built man; and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of\ndetermination and energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.\n\nIf theres a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man\nfor it, he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger. The\nway you kept on my trail was a caution.\n\nYou had better come with me, said Holmes to the two detectives.\n\nI can drive you, said Lestrade.\n\nGood! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an\ninterest in the case and may as well stick to us.\n\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no attempt\nat escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his, and we followed\nhim. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very\nshort time to our destination. We were ushered into a small chamber where a\npolice Inspector noted down our prisoners name and the names of the men with\nwhose murder he had been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional\nman, who went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. The prisoner will\nbe put before the magistrates in the course of the week, he said; in the\nmean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must\nwarn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\n\nIve got a good deal to say, our prisoner said slowly. I want to tell you\ngentlemen all about it.\n\nHadnt you better reserve that for your trial? asked the Inspector.\n\nI may never be tried, he answered. You neednt look startled. It isnt\nsuicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor? He turned his fierce dark eyes\nupon me as he asked this last question.\n\nYes; I am, I answered.\n\nThen put your hand here, he said, with a smile, motioning with his manacled\nwrists towards his chest.\n\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and\ncommotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to thrill\nand quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was\nat work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing\nnoise which proceeded from the same source.\n\nWhy, I cried, you have an aortic aneurism!\n\nThats what they call it, he said, placidly. I went to a Doctor last week\nabout it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed. It\nhas been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-\nfeeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. Ive done my work now, and I dont care\nhow soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind\nme. I dont want to be remembered as a common cut-throat.\n\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\n\nDo you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger? the former asked,\n24\n\nMost certainly there is, I answered.\n\nIn that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his\nstatement, said the Inspector. You are at liberty, sir, to give your\naccount, which I again warn you will be taken down.\n\nIll sit down, with your leave, the prisoner said, suiting the action to the\nword. This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half\nan hour ago has not mended matters. Im on the brink of the grave, and I am\nnot likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you\nuse it is a matter of no consequence to me.\n\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began the\nfollowing remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as\nthough the events which he narrated were commonplace enough. I can vouch for\nthe accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrades\nnote-book, in which the prisoners words were taken down exactly as they were\nuttered.\n\nIt dont much matter to you why I hated these men, he said; its enough\nthat they were guilty of the death of two human beingsa father and a\ndaughterand that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives. After the\nlapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to\nsecure a conviction against them in any court. I knew of their guilt though,\nand I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into\none. Youd have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been\nin my place.\n\nThat girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She was\nforced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over it. I took\nthe marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his dying eyes should\nrest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts should be of the crime\nfor which he was punished. I have carried it about with me, and have followed\nhim and his accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought\nto tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely\nenough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done. They\nhave perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to\ndesire.\n\nThey were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow\nthem. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must\nturn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding are as natural to\nme as walking, so I applied at a cabowners office, and soon got employment. I\nwas to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I\nmight keep for myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape\nalong somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of\nall the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had\na map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and\nstations, I got on pretty well.\n\nIt was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I\ninquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They were at a\nboarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I\nfound them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and\nthere was no chance of their recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them\nuntil I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me\nagain.\n\nThey were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London,\nI was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and\nsometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get\naway from me. It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could\nearn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer. I did not\nmind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.\n\nThey were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was some\nchance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never\nafter nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never\nonce saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but\nStangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them late and early, but\nnever saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told\nme that the hour had almost come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest\nmight burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.\n\nAt last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street\nwas called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door.\nPresently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and\nStangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse and kept within\nsight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to\nshift their quarters. At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold\nmy horse, and followed them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the\nLiverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would\nnot be another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but\nDrebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in the\nbustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. Drebber said\nthat he had a little business of his own to do, and that if the other would\nwait for him he would soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him,\nand reminded him that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered\nthat the matter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not\ncatch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\nreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he must\nnot presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job,\nand simply bargained with him that if he missed the last train he should\nrejoin him at Hallidays Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he\nwould be back on the platform before eleven, and made his way out of the\nstation.\n\nThe moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my enemies\nwithin my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were\nat my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation. My plans were\nalready formed. There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has\ntime to realize who it is that strikes him, and why retribution has come upon\nhim. I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making\nthe man who had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It\nchanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over\nsome houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my\ncarriage. It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval\nI had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of\nthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely\nupon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the\ndifficult problem which I had now to solve.\n\nHe walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for\nnearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he staggered in his\nwalk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of\nme, and he hailed it. I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was\nwithin a yard of his driver the whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge\nand through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves\nback in the Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his\nintention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred\nyards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me\na glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\n\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\n\nThats better, he said. Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more,\nwhen suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house. Next\nmoment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber,\nand the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before. This fellow had\nDrebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him\na shove and a kick which sent him half across the road. You hound, he cried,\nshaking his stick at him; Ill teach you to insult an honest girl! He was so\nhot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the\ncur staggered away down the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran\nas far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in.\nDrive me to Hallidays Private Hotel, said he.\n\nWhen I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I\nfeared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove along\nslowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might take him right\nout into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview\nwith him. I had almost decided upon this, when he solved the problem for me.\nThe craze for drink had seized him again, and he ordered me to pull up outside\na gin palace. He went in, leaving word that I should wait for him. There he\nremained until closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I\nknew the game was in my own hands.\n\nDont imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only have\nbeen rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it. I\nhad long determined that he should have a show for his life if he chose to\ntake advantage of it. Among the many billets which I have filled in America\nduring my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory\nat York College. One day the professor was lecturing on poisions, 25 and he\nshowed his students some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted\nfrom some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the\nleast grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this\npreparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little\nof it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small,\nsoluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without\nthe poison. I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen\nshould each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that\nremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing\nacross a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me,\nand the time had now come when I was to use them.\n\nIt was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and\nraining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad withinso glad that\nI could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you gentlemen have\never pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then\nsuddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a\ncigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and\nmy temples throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier\nand sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as\nplain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on\neach side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\n\nThere was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping\nof the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled\ntogether in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, Its time to get out, I\nsaid.\n\nAll right, cabby, said he.\n\nI suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned, for he\ngot out without another word, and followed me down the garden. I had to walk\nbeside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little top-heavy. When we\ncame to the door, I opened it, and led him into the front room. I give you my\nword that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of\nus.\n\nIts infernally dark, said he, stamping about.\n\nWell soon have a light, I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax\ncandle which I had brought with me. Now, Enoch Drebber, I continued, turning\nto him, and holding the light to my own face, who am I?\n\nHe gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a\nhorror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me\nthat he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the\nperspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head.\nAt the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. I\nhad always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the\ncontentment of soul which now possessed me.\n\nYou dog! I said; I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg,\nand you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings have come to an\nend, for either you or I shall never see to-morrows sun rise. He shrunk\nstill further away as I spoke, and I could see on his face that he thought I\nwas mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-\nhammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had\nnot gushed from my nose and relieved me.\n\nWhat do you think of Lucy Ferrier now? I cried, locking the door, and\nshaking the key in his face. Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has\novertaken you at last. I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He would\nhave begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.\n\nWould you murder me? he stammered.\n\nThere is no murder, I answered. Who talks of murdering a mad dog? What\nmercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her slaughtered\nfather, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless harem.\n\nIt was not I who killed her father, he cried.\n\nBut it was you who broke her innocent heart, I shrieked, thrusting the box\nbefore him. Let the high God judge between us. Choose and eat. There is death\nin one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there\nis justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.\n\nHe cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife\nand held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed the other,\nand we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to\nsee which was to live and which was to die. Shall I ever forget the look which\ncame over his face when the first warning pangs told him that the poison was\nin his system? I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucys marriage ring in front\nof his eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid.\nA spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of\nhim, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There was no\nmovement. He was dead!\n\nThe blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I\ndont know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with\nit. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong\ntrack, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered a German being\nfound in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it was argued at the\ntime in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed\nthat what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my\nfinger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall. Then\nI walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the\nnight was still very wild. I had driven some distance when I put my hand into\nthe pocket in which I usually kept Lucys ring, and found that it was not\nthere. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of\nher. Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebbers body,\nI drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the\nhousefor I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring. When I\narrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming\nout, and only managed to disarm his suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly\ndrunk.\n\nThat was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was to do as\nmuch for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferriers debt. I knew that he was\nstaying at Hallidays Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he never\ncame out. 26 fancy that he suspected something when Drebber failed to put in\nan appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his guard. If he\nthought he could keep me off by staying indoors he was very much mistaken. I\nsoon found out which was the window of his bedroom, and early next morning I\ntook advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel,\nand so made my way into his room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and\ntold him that the hour had come when he was to answer for the life he had\ntaken so long before. I described Drebbers death to him, and I gave him the\nsame choice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of safety\nwhich that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my throat. In self-\ndefence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been the same in any case,\nfor Providence would never have allowed his guilty hand to pick out anything\nbut the poison.\n\nI have little more to say, and its as well, for I am about done up. I went\non cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save\nenough to take me back to America. I was standing in the yard when a ragged\nyoungster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said\nthat his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round,\nsuspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the\nbracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled 27 as ever I saw in my life.\nThats the whole of my story, gentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer;\nbut I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.\n\nSo thrilling had the mans narrative been, and his manner was so impressive\nthat we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional detectives, _blas_\nas they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the\nmans story. When he finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was\nonly broken by the scratching of Lestrades pencil as he gave the finishing\ntouches to his shorthand account.\n\nThere is only one point on which I should like a little more information,\nSherlock Holmes said at last. Who was your accomplice who came for the ring\nwhich I advertised?\n\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. I can tell my own secrets, he\nsaid, but I dont get other people into trouble. I saw your advertisement,\nand I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted. My\nfriend volunteered to go and see. I think youll own he did it smartly.\n\nNot a doubt of that, said Holmes heartily.\n\nNow, gentlemen, the Inspector remarked gravely, the forms of the law must\nbe complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the\nmagistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be\nresponsible for him. He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led\noff by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the\nStation and took a cab back to Baker Street.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION.\n\nWE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but\nwhen the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony. A higher Judge\nhad taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a\ntribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him. On the very night\nafter his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning\nstretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as\nthough he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life,\nand on work well done.\n\nGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death, Holmes remarked, as we\nchatted it over next evening. Where will their grand advertisement be now?\n\nI dont see that they had very much to do with his capture, I answered.\n\nWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence, returned my\ncompanion, bitterly. The question is, what can you make people believe that\nyou have done. Never mind, he continued, more brightly, after a pause. I\nwould not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better\ncase within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most\ninstructive points about it.\n\nSimple! I ejaculated.\n\nWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise, said Sherlock Holmes,\nsmiling at my surprise. The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that\nwithout any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand\nupon the criminal within three days.\n\nThat is true, said I.\n\nI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a\nguide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand\nthing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment,\nand a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day\naffairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes\nto be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can\nreason analytically.\n\nI confess, said I, that I do not quite follow you.\n\nI hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most\npeople, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the\nresult would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue\nfrom them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however,\nwho, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner\nconsciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is\nwhat I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.\n\nI understand, said I.\n\nNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find\neverything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the different\nsteps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as\nyou know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I\nnaturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already\nexplained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by\ninquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was\na cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The\nordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentlemans brougham.\n\nThis was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden path,\nwhich happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking\nimpressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush,\nbut to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no\nbranch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the\nart of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it,\nand much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks\nof the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first\npassed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the\nothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the\nothers coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed,\nwhich told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable\nfor his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other\nfashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by\nhis boots.\n\nOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man\nlay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was.\nThere was no wound upon the dead mans person, but the agitated expression\nupon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon\nhim. Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any\nchance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead mans\nlips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he\nhad had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon\nhim from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of\nexclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet\nthe facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible\nadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The\ncases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once\nto any toxicologist.\n\nAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been\nthe object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was\nit a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the\nfirst to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do\ntheir work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most\ndeliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room,\nshowing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private\nwrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge.\nWhen the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than\never to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was\nfound, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I\nasked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any\nparticular point in Mr. Drebbers former career. He answered, you remember, in\nthe negative.\n\nI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed\nme in my opinion as to the murderers height, and furnished me with the\nadditional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails. I\nhad already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle,\nthat the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderers nose in\nhis excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the\ntrack of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded,\nbreaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the\ncriminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had\njudged correctly.\n\nHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the\ncircumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was\nconclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of\nthe law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same\nHope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery\nin my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.\n\nI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the\nhouse with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The\nmarks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which\nwould have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then,\ncould the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to\nsuppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very\neyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly,\nsupposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means\ncould he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the\nirresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys\nof the Metropolis.\n\nIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be.\nOn the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to\ndraw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue\nto perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under\nan assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew\nhis original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and\nsent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted\nout the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took\nadvantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of\nStangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could\nhardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You\nsee the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.\n\nIt is wonderful! I cried. Your merits should be publicly recognized. You\nshould publish an account of the case. If you wont, I will for you.\n\nYou may do what you like, Doctor, he answered. See here! he continued,\nhanding a paper over to me, look at this!\n\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was\ndevoted to the case in question.\n\nThe public, it said, have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death\nof the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of\nMr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will probably be never known\nnow, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result\nof an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part.\nIt seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter\nDay Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City.\nIf the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most\nstriking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve\nas a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds\nat home, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret that\nthe credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland\nYard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was apprehended, it\nappears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an\namateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such\ninstructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill. It is\nexpected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers\nas a fitting recognition of their services.\n\nDidnt I tell you so when we started? cried Sherlock Holmes with a laugh.\nThats the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a testimonial!\n\nNever mind, I answered, I have all the facts in my journal, and the public\nshall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented by the\nconsciousness of success, like the Roman miser\n\n    \n    \r\n                Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\r\n           Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.\r\n     \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n##  ORIGINAL TRANSCRIBERS NOTES:\n\n1 (return)  \n[ Frontispiece, with the caption: He examined with his glass the word upon\nthe wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness.

Special rules,\r\n    set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to\r\n    copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to\r\n    protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project\r\n    Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you\r\n    charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you\r\n    do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the\r\n    rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose\r\n    such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and\r\n    research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do\r\n    practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.

General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    electronic works\r\n    \r\n    1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to\r\n    and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property\r\n    (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all\r\n    the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy\r\n    all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.\r\n    If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the\r\n    terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or\r\n    entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.\r\n    \r\n    1.B.  Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark.  It may only be\r\n    used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who\r\n    agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few\r\n    things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\r\n    even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See\r\n    paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement\r\n    and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\n    works.  See paragraph 1.E below.\r\n    \r\n    1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (the Foundation\r\n     or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the\r\n    collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an\r\n    individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are\r\n    located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from\r\n    copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative\r\n    works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg\r\n    are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by\r\n    freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of\r\n    this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with\r\n    the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by\r\n    keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.\r\n    \r\n    1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern\r\n    what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in\r\n    a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check\r\n    the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement\r\n    before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or\r\n    creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning\r\n    the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United\r\n    States.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:\r\n    \r\n    1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate\r\n    access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently\r\n    whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the\r\n    phrase Project Gutenberg appears, or with which the phrase Project\r\n    Gutenberg is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,\r\n    copied or distributed:\r\n    \r\n    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\r\n    almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or\r\n    re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\r\n    with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\r\n    \r\n    1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived\r\n    from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is\r\n    posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied\r\n    and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees\r\n    or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work\r\n    with the phrase Project Gutenberg associated with or appearing on the\r\n    work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1\r\n    through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the\r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or\r\n    1.E.9.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted\r\n    with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution\r\n    must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional\r\n    terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked\r\n    to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the\r\n    permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this\r\n    work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this\r\n    electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without\r\n    prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with\r\n    active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm License.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,\r\n    compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any\r\n    word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or\r\n    distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than\r\n    Plain Vanilla ASCII or other format used in the official version\r\n    posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),\r\n    you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a\r\n    copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon\r\n    request, of the work in its original Plain Vanilla ASCII or other\r\n    form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,\r\n    performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works\r\n    unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing\r\n    access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided\r\n    that\r\n    \r\n    - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from\r\n         the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method\r\n         you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is\r\n         owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he\r\n         has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the\r\n         Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments\r\n         must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you\r\n         prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax\r\n         returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and\r\n         sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the\r\n         address specified in Section 4, Information about donations to\r\n         the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.\r\n     \r\n    - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies\r\n         you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he\r\n         does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n         License.  You must require such a user to return or\r\n         destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium\r\n         and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of\r\n         Project Gutenberg-tm works.\r\n    \r\n    - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any\r\n         money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the\r\n         electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days\r\n         of receipt of the work.\r\n    \r\n    - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free\r\n         distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.\r\n    \r\n    1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set\r\n    forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from\r\n    both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael\r\n    Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the\r\n    Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\n    effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\n    public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\n    works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n    Defects, such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\n    corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\n    property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\n    computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\n    your equipment.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the Right\r\n    of Replacement or Refund described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project\r\n    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all\r\n    liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal\r\n    fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT\r\n    LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE\r\n    PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE\r\n    TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE\r\n    LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR\r\n    INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\r\n    DAMAGE.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a\r\n    defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can\r\n    receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a\r\n    written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you\r\n    received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with\r\n    your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with\r\n    the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a\r\n    refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity\r\n    providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to\r\n    receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy\r\n    is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further\r\n    opportunities to fix the problem.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth\r\n    in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you AS-IS WITH NO OTHER\r\n    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\r\n    WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied\r\n    warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.\r\n    If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the\r\n    law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be\r\n    interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by\r\n    the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any\r\n    provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.\r\n    \r\n    1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the\r\n    trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone\r\n    providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance\r\n    with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,\r\n    promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,\r\n    harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,\r\n    that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do\r\n    or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any\r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    \r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\n    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\n    including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\n    because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\n    people in all walks of life.\r\n    \r\n    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\n    assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tms\r\n    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\n    remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\n    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\n    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\n    To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n    and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\n    and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\n    Foundation\r\n    \r\n    The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n    501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\n    state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\n    Revenue Service.  The Foundations EIN or federal tax identification\r\n    number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\n    http://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\n    Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\n    permitted by U.S. federal laws and your states laws.\r\n    \r\n    The Foundations principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\n    Fairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\n    throughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n    809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\n    business@pglaf.org.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\n    Literary Archive Foundation\r\n    \r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\n    spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\n    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\n    freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\n    array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\n    status with the IRS.\r\n    \r\n    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\n    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\n    States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\n    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\n    with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\n    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\n    SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\n    particular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n    \r\n    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\n    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\n    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\n    approach us with offers to donate.\r\n    \r\n    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\n    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\n    outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n    \r\n    Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\n    methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\n    ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\n    To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\n    works.\r\n    \r\n    Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n    concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\n    with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\n    Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\n    editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\n    unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\n    keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n    \r\n         http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n    \r\n    This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\n    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\n    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\n    subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \n\n'
